I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  \n\nMy two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  \n\nI ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  \n\nThe service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  \n\nAdded bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg"}

I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  \n\nHusband and I ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at Schenley Park overlook.  Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latt\u00e9 with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latt\u00e9.  Both were excellent.\n\nFor my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.\n\nAnd that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.

The dishes are original and creative, not like anything one can find elsewhere. I don't like tofu so much, but their tofu appetizer is fantastic - and is a large portion for a moderate cost. The chopped salad is worthy of my daily cravings. They usually have two vegetarian entrees, one or both of which can be made vegan. For a long while they had an awesome rice cake dish that I could not resist - it was a take on pesto with neato chewy rice cake noodle things and a seasonal mix of veggies and mushrooms. I do miss that one. But lately I've been getting the thakkali curry, which is pretty good too, with an interesting take on mango pickle (spicy!) and sadly, it comes with the best paratha in town. \n\nOnce I had a bad experience with the rice cake dish - it came out all wrong. I was unable to complain at the table due to my company...but I emailed the manager because I wanted them to know that somebody in the kitchen didn't seem to be gettin' it. I also took that opportunity of contact to ask for a recipe for some to-die-for brussels sprouts they used to have on their sides menu that were no longer available. The response was above and beyond what I could have expected. Everything was made up for and then some. And they apparently didn't have the recipe I requested on record, but gave me a general run down of how to make it from memory; now I make them at home according to Soba's instructions every time!\n\nThe drinks! Excellent. Some of my favorites are The Metamorphosis (no longer on menu, but I think you can still get it), Offer You Can't Refuse, The Dirty Pickle, La Pinta and Beauty Mark...They also have a nice selection of Sake, which is rare in Pittsburgh, however is is expensive to buy here. \n\nThe atmosphere is not really my style, but it passes as a cool calm romantic space. I do get sick of hearing the same music every time I go, but there are some great songs in the mix. The service is hit or miss, and some of the servers come off as scripted (probably new).

The main reason I like it is that they offer a slew of natural and even a few organic items.  Other reasons I like it is the salad bar with organic mixed greens and the array of toppings you can choose.  It's also a clean establishment, and the service is very quick.  You also get free soft serve ice cream for dessert if you choose to indulge a little bit.  The salad bar also has complimentary mini muffins which are quite tasty.  \n\nThe main negative is the price.  While the salad bar is fairly priced at about $8, you will have to pay extra if you want proteins such as grilled chicken or chicken salad.  They at least have some hard-boiled eggs included in the bar if you want those for protein, as well as some cheese.So if you want a salad with chicken as well as a drink, you're looking at about $11-12, more than you would pay at Ruby Tuesday's for a similar thing, and in a less enjoyable environment.  Another negative, at least to me, is that this place is overrun by south Charlotte kids who have control over their parents.  We witnessed one child smack her mother and neither parent did anything about it.  That was just one of the seemingly 1000 children running freely throughout the place and screaming.  It seriously felt like Chuck E. Cheese.    Another negative, as someone else mentioned, is that there is probably just too much on the menu.  As such, their is no menu board.  People have to take a menu from the counter and then order which causes confusion.\n\nI probably won't go running back to Jason's Deli based mainly on the price, but if it's dinner time and I do, I will likely get my food to go.

It looks to be built from one of the renovated homes there in the neighborhood with a 'dollhouse' style exterior in my opinion.

She is so personable and just great at her job.  If you go before 7 any day of the week the bar food is discounted to a very reasonable rate. I tried the lobster roll and the steak sliders. Both pretty delicious. We also tried the beer carpaccio off the regular menu because I love beef carpaccio. A lot. A whole lot. The regular diner menu is a bit pricey but that's to be expected with these types of establishments. The carpaccio was amazing and the arugala salad on top of it was delicious. With the carpaccio I wish they didn't put grated parm on it (I felt it cheapened it-just go with the shaved fresh parm and call it done!) and there were no capers. I am used to having capers on carpaccio but to each his own. \n\nFor dessert (which I usually skip) I went with Shannon's glowing recommendation of the doughnuts. Oh. My. God. They are hot and fresh and delicious. Rolled in cinnamon sugar they come with two dipping sauces and some whipped cream. These are made for splitting I would assume because there were a lot of holes.

Ever. Armed with this knowledge I was bracing myself for an... interesting experience. Hibachi is generally standard across the board for me. It's not a hit or miss type of cuisine. In terms of the actual hibachi, everyone does the same exact thing with some minor twists here and there, so it's all about the quality of ingredients and service. Lets just say I held my toungue when asked how I liked my meal at the end of the day.\n\nThe Service:\n- A little slow honestly, it took them forever to get my beer (not cool bro) and even longer to come get my order. Friendly people as per the usual, but for some reason they are on asian standard time when it comes to serving you.\n\nThe Food:\n- Standard hibachi food, solid but nothing special. A big plus for me are the portions. They tend to give you larger portions than other restaurants along with the traditional soup, salad, shrimp, and veggies. In fact, this is the only place I've seen that gives you noodles with your dish at no extra cost. Well played Nakato. \n\nThe Ambiance\n- Gotta love the ambiance. My cook was playful and had fun with the kids (which is a must, they love attention). The decor was great, modern with a little rustic feel to make you ease into your surroundings. \n\nOverall, wouldn't jump the gun saying its the best hibachi I've ever had, but I also won't be coming here regularly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xLZilmaLXY0r-dBFaiLxww"}

I've fed employees countless times over the years and this never happened to me before. \n\nAs I mentioned it doesn't look or taste quite like a traditional pizza.

I asked the owner about it, he told me he's been making pizza for 30 years and everything was prepared in house, including the dough, sauces etc. \n\nMy favorite still is the individual pie with mushrooms, well cooked onions ( I can't stand undercooked onions) a mild sausage more knockwurst than Italian and my twist: a fried egg on top, sunny side up.

The cheese is 40 cents extra...and on my walleye sandwich, it one only one slice of American cheese,  over a sandwich that was about about the size of a good sub, 3\"x7\", you could hardly  SEE the cheese, much less taste it, and I expect more when you're paying 40 cents extra! The cod sandwich portion is quite a bit smaller in size and is served on  a hot dog bun. I wish they would note this on the menu. FYI: the fish is served on wheat buns. It's the squishy and sweet bread that tastes almost the same as a white hot dog bun... I wish they had better bread. The tomatoes I've gotten have been mixed...some a bit overripe and generally thickly sliced. They use a green leaf lettuce (what you would use as a garnish), which tends to get limp/slimy fast on a hot sandwich- I think they would do better to use a crispy romaine or iceberg lettuce. The tartar sauce was decent and I like that they have hot sauce on all the tables. \n\nThe restaurant itself is small, just a few tables but it's very clean and the service is very friendly.

I have been hearing about Sam's breakfast, in particular the french toast, for months now.  I love french toast, it is my favorite breakfast food.  I wasn't expecting much, thinking that it was sure to be less fantastic than my boyfriend claimed it to be.\n\nSam's is the epitome of a greasy spoon.   No frills decor, you walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom and your table is likely to be wobbly.  The server took care of us but was busy with other tables so the service was polite and attentive but short and sweet.  We each ordered a breakfast special and then split an order of french toast.  The breakfast special items (eggs, meat, toast, hashbrowns) were basic but good.  The french toast?  Ridiculous.  Seriously, the best french toast I've ever had.  The cook dips the bread in thinned out pancake batter and then fries it up.  It is rich, crispy and seasoned with powdered sugar and cinnamon.  It was a tasty breakfast on a cold, rainy day.  When the Illini basketball team walked in the door, my boyfriend was in heaven.  \n\nAt the end of the meal we realized that we didn't have any cash and Sam's doesn't take cards.  Because my boyfriend was a regular in his college days, Gus, the owner, was nice enough to let us leave, get some cash and come back to pay.  Our total was about as pleasing as the french toast.  12 bucks and change for two coffees, two specials and french toast.  Crazy cheap.  Sam's is far away from home, but we'll visit everytime we're in Champaign.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2UAbUSTMsR9G26A8AYO3dA"}

(other wise this is 2 stars the food is that different)\n\n You might not get offered the black menu and you have to ask for it or pick one up as we did. We were slightly offended by this,maybe they do this with good intentions but it isn't right to offer some guest certain dishes,you just don't do this in business  and if my companion was doing the Yelp he'd only give one star for that reason. One menu with an Americanized page(s) would be right.\n\n We ordered the Szechwan beef, from one menu (Americanized) ,spicy cucumbers and water boiled fish from the Black Menu. We received water we were going to order beverages but our server dashed away. \n\nWe received the cucumbers and (Americanized) Szechwan beef platter that were dropped off by our server running as fast as the Bugs Bunny Road Runner almost splashing at us with a big thuds on the table and jerky movements reminiscent of WW2 Nazis.\n\nThe Americanized Szechwan beef was just OK , and not as tasty as others we had before but not bad, but not so great lacking seasoning and taste.\n\nThe spicy cucumbers (black menu) were special, first bite I thought slightly oily but tasty and so crisp and then you have to just keep eating them like pistachios.\n\nMaybe 10 minutes latter she  (the WB Roadrunner Nazi)  dumped water boiled chicken INSTEAD of the water boiled fish I ordered.  (I didn't complain since it was the same dish but chicken)The dish sounds bland but was extraordinary in taste that smacks you with an ILLEGAL DRUG LIKE EFFECT were each bite gets better and better and you have to keep eating it. The water boiled chicken came piping hot in a well made seasoned stock with napa cabbage. Oil and the right amount of  Szechwan peppercorns float on the top of this large enough for two meal,it was addictive and delicious ,not a building hot spice but completely different . My companion had to eat half along with me after he ate his plate. (the water boiled chicken really was that good) and I think it only cost $9 and also came with a big pot of rice.\n\nAs soon as we finished the check was dropped off and plates were NOT cleared.\n\nIF you order from black menu I feel this place is a Gem of Phoenix!

The Beef with Broccoli was just ok, but for the price, I couldn't complain. The sauce with pretty thick, which I mixed into the rice for a pleasant consistency. One of my coworkers got the \"average tasting\" House Chicken, and another had the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce. Not only did we literally receive the bill before it arrived, she was terribly unhappy with the seafood quality and flavor. Her Diet Coke didn't show up till the end either - producing more sour reviews on her part.  My \"veggie soup\" consisted of a piece of broccoli, three carrots and an onion slice soaked in wonton broth. Go with the egg drop instead.\n\nI will mention that we were already grossly disappointed having learned the Golden Buddha was closed and it's hard to compete with them.

That isn't what is wrong with Cherry Blossom.\n\nThe problem with Cherry Blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse. I have taken my family there at least a dozen times and it appears as if the service which was so-so to begin with has deteriorated to just plain incompetent. Today was the final straw. My wife and I arrived there at 11:35 am for an early lunch and while the place was not empty, it was not packed either. We were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived. The server promptly took our drink order and brought it to us. She said she'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu. A few minutes went by, then another few minutes, then another and by 11:57, our order had still not been taken. At that point, my wife flagged down the host who took our order. I should point out that both my wife and I had ordered two simple lunch items from the menu without any substitutions or special requests. Two minutes later (around 11:59) our server appeared and asked if we had decided what we wanted. After informing her that we just gave our order to the host, she vanished. Both our orders were supposed to come with soup and salad and still by 12:14, neither had arrived. At that point, more people had arrived and the several tables in the back room where we were had become occupied. We also noticed that these customers, who arrived well after we had, had been served their salads, soups and even their meals while we sat there waiting. At that point I went to speak with the host about where our missing salads and soups were and she smiled politely but did not respond. My wife and I decided we were not going to pay for such incompetent service and just walked out. The last time I was there, the service was slow and they did not bring one of the salads for one of the meals we ordered. Other times we have gone there and waited 10 minutes to even be asked for our drink order when the place was not even half full. It just seems to get worse and worse at Cherry Blossom.\n\nSo in conclusion. If you enjoy sitting and waiting while watching other customers who walked in 10 or 15 minutes or more after you did get their orders taken and served their food, this is the place for you. It is my belief that management is to blame for Cherry Blossom's poor service. Fortunately, I can take my money and spend it elsewhere and that's just what we did after we left. Cherry Blossom will not be getting any more visits from us.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg"}

It's pretty cozy inside, like someone said, Asian European.  The menu is huge.  I'm typically a picky person and will only find one or two things on any given menu that I want to eat, but this menu...I would try half of it.\n\nHowever, I had a hankerin' for sushi, so that's what I ordered.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have an individual selection of nigiri to choose from, but they did have a combo option for nigiri, which is usually what I like to see anyway.  I decided to try the Philly roll and the Alaskan roll.  I was also concerned this might not fill me up, so I also ordered a bowl of miso ($2).\n\nFirst of all, the miso was delicious.  It had raw cabbage in it, which I didn't really like (nor have I seen it before), but other than that, it was one of the best miso soups I've ever had.  Secondly, the Philly roll was awesome!  It was made with smoked salmon, which made it a million times more delicious than usual. The Alaskan roll had cooked salmon, and it was good, but couldn't compare to the Philly roll with smoked salmon.\n\nAlso, I didn't realize they served bread at the table (wasn't really expecting that at an Asian restaurant).  We had two rolls and two cinnamon and sugar crostinis in our basket.  They were both good.  Nothing special about the rolls, though.  Just your typical dinner roll.  Because of the bread, I ended up being super full at the end of my meal, which I wasn't expecting at all.\n\nMy fiance ordered the shrimp pad thai.  He asked for super-extra hot, but it came not spicy at all.  They gave him chili sauce, though, which helped him out.  He absolutely loved it.  Normally, he doesn't really like Thai or Japanese food that much, but he couldn't stop talking about how good his food was.  That's a giant thumbs up for this place, just for impressing him with Thai food.\n\nOverall it was excellent.  We went at 8pm on a Sunday night and the place was packed.  I see that as a great sign.  Our service was normal, nothing to complain about, so overall, the two of us gives Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe 5 stars :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg"}

Sweet and tart, but not too much of either, this drink is awesome!\n\nMany awesome things on the menu, great daily specials, & you can really taste the love and local difference in all of their menu items.  The service is 97% awesome, very seldom do I get slow service there & it has never been slow enough to irritate me.\n\nDefinitely a go to place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ"}

This was one of my favorite places to visit, to introduce newcomers to, treat family and friends, and for a time I'd visit once every two months or so. My previous three visits have not gone so well; I'll relate my latest visit which took place just over a week ago. A friend attempted to make reservations for two on a Thursday. He was told that due to a policy change by  Richardson, a reservation for two on a Thursday could no longer be taken, as there was disappointment that their business for tables of 4 or more were suffering. Okay, I can understand, business decisions have to be made, but cut your nose off to spite your face? However, the woman that answered the phone let us know there should be no problem getting a table. I was seated shortly before my friend arrived so I had a chance to look over the menu. To my surprise, some changes have been made. First, a salad choice (and they're all very typically very yummy), anyway, a choice is no longer offered. Instead, the house salad is offered at $4 with the entree purchase. Next, a statement is now printed across the top of the menu letting the patron know \"you order it, you bought it\"...is this REALLY necessary? While the server and busboy were friendly and helpful (my water glass was never empty), my $4 house salad arrived about 90 seconds before our entrees did. Oh, the accompanying bread was hard as stone and arrived with my salad, while an attentive server should have brought it along just after our drinks were served, as my dinner partner hadn't ordered a salad. Oh, my friend, he's typically a big fan of the Steak Rokerij, and absolutely loves the crab/hollandaise sauce mixture. As normal, he asked for more sauce. On this visit, we found $10 added to the check for that request. We found that unusual for Rokerij. Things have certainly changed. I was willing to overlook these changes, after all, the economy is poor these days. I excused myself to use the men's room. After all, we did have Chimay (Rokerij has never had a wide beer selection). I found the towel basket to be so PACKED with paper-towels, I couldn't get one out of the basket, which is on a vanity so small, when you turn the water on, the towels become soaked. This explains the stained, linen towel basket liner...the stains were grays and greens. Overall, I feel that these things add up to failing to pay attention to detail. It's a shame really. I really hope the best for Richardson and hope Rokerij can return to it's former self.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg"}

It can spoil the experience when you are focused on what you paid, and not on enjoying the savory feeling of the food in your mouth.\n\nMy wife and I, at the Wrigley Mansion for my birthday, couldn't believe that this place is racking up a high average review. It was unbelievably bad. The food was marginal -- so marginal that we wondered, are we in the same restaurant that these others reviewed? And the \"deal\" that we went in with . . .  wow, what a loser. We had a Travelzoo prepaid voucher, which was supposedly worth $120. That voucher was for an appetizer, a soup or salad, and an entree. According to them, this voucher would pay for food for two that would at its normal price be valued at $120. And they base their add-on gratuity on this inflated figure, as well as the tax.\n\nWhat did we get? The appetizer was a one or two bite item -- two one-bite crab cakes, the size of quarters, and a teacup with one escargot in the bottom of it (our choices). The bowl of soup was actually a teacup as well. The entree we both had was a salmon, a very small filet, and when one of us expressed a concern about an allergy, they took the side dish away that contained the allergen and didn't replace it with anything. Most restaurants would have a baked potato or something to substitute. \n\nWe ended up paying, after they added the gratuity in and the taxes based on the inflated retail price, nearly $120 for this dinner for two that included only two drinks, a well drink with house rum and a house cabernet.  That was our \"voucher deal\" price. That's absurd . . . the Salmon dinner could be had in a larger portion in any restaurant in town for $18-24. The cup of soup perhaps $5-7 and the microscopic \"tasting\" of an appetizer would be a courtesy item or certainly no more than a few $$. How does this equate to what we paid?\n\nWhile the views are nice at the Wrigley Mansion and the place itself is unique, this operation is using it as an excuse to gouge. Don't visit this establishment -- seriously, like many others, you will regret it. Stay as far away as you can from Geordie's. Spend your money at innumerable restaurants with better value in other parts of Phoenix.

I'm happy to say that after eating at Thai Lahna with Jim W. and his wife Audrey, we now have another Thai place besides Swaddee (in Chandler) and Wild Thaiger (in downtown) that we're not just ok with going to but actually excited about. \n\nI'm docking Thai Lahna one star for the *really* slow service (I don't recommend going if you're on the verge of starving or with people you don't have much to say to), the less-than-stellar appetizers (the chicken satay was pretty bland and we've had better angel wings elsewhere), and that damn bright light from cars that were parking that kept blinding us that Jim W. mentioned in his review. \n\nAll this aside, Thai Lahna's super-flavorful main dishes merit four stars. The Khung Nahm Prik Pow was filled with high-quality shrimp (rare for Phoenix!), lots of well-chosenand fresh vegetables, and a really complex and rich curry and chili sauce. It was different than any sautee I've had at a Thai restaurant before but incredibly delicious. The Mussaman Curry was also a real standout. The beef wasn't as high-quality or tender as the beef that comes in Wild Thaiger's version of the same dish, but the curry itself was rich, flavorful, and not overly coconutty (if that isn't a word, it should be). The pineapple fried rice was also super satisfying, but be forewarned that if you ask for it spicy (as my husband did), it will be just that - sinus-clearing spicy. My husband and I weren't in love with the Pad Thai (Phaht Thai on their menu) - we prefer it a little more savory and a little less saucey - but it was one of the better we've had in Phoenix and Jim W. is right that the noodles' sweetness was necessary in this case to balance out the intense spiciness of that rice!\n\nThai Lahna serves authentic and flavorful Thai food that meets our Bay Area standards, and we will definitely be back. We won't, however, come when we are too hungry and we will probably avoid the appetizers and just go straight to the entree good stuff.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wct7rZKyZqZftzmAU-vhWQ"}

We picked this place based on the positive online reviews. The place was unimpressive looking, but there was quite a wait which I took as a good sign (nobody lines up and waits for bad food...or at least they shouldn't). After half an hour we got seated. They placed us in what looked like an addition to the building and it was freezing! They had the A/C blasting and a ceiling fan going. Our server was very nice, and our drinks and salads came out rather quick. Then it took a turn for the worse. Well over an hour passed between receiving our drinks/salads and when our meals where finally brought out to us. During that time, none of our drinks were refilled, our used plates weren't removed, and no one came to check on us until the hour mark. When our food did come out it was nice and piping hot, but it was also unrecognizable. Every plate was drowning in marinara sauce. You had to do some serious excavating to uncover your food. And the food was pretty mad. We ordered spaghetti, eggplant parmesan, and the manicotti. Ragu tastes better than the sauce that they seemingly have an neverending supply of. And the eggplant was mushy and unflavorful. To add insult to injury, the prices were absurd! They charged prices on par with higher end Italian restaurants...yet this place is a far cry from anything upscale. Maybe this place is only good for the pizza, but based on this experience I'm not willing to give it a second chance.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0gQrhOYWdO0XVZEKtOrvaA"}

He's worked here for seventeen years and he will make sure you have a good experience.  5 and Diner is a great choice for families.  The fifties themed decor is fun for all.  Just wish the juke box system worked. On my most recent visit I had to try to explain the concept of a hula hoop to a three year old.  Since a demonstration was out of the question, I'm afraid this little one will have to wait for later clarification.  She did enjoy coloring the paper hat the restaurant provided, however, and her folks enjoyed the $2.75 price tag on the generous junior pancake breakfast.  The menu also features a separate section for seniors.  While technically you have to be fifty-five to order from this section of the menu, in my experience servers will allow anyone who would prefer these smaller portions and prices to order them.  A note about prices.  While the kids menu prices are very reasonable, select off menu junior beverages are a bit pricey (juice $1.79) and can drive up your total cost.  There is also a loyalty card that will help stretch the dollar of frequent diners.\n\nThe Southwest Omelet was perfect on our recent visit and definitely worth a taste.  The pancakes were uniform and served hot. In all honesty, however, it's the decor and the friendly staff that earns the restaurant four stars in this review. Menu offerings are solid, with a few amusing names scattered throughout, but are for the most part predictable and basic.  But come to think about it, isn't that what you want from a fifties diner?\n\nEven though 5 and Diner is not a \"genuine\" fifties diner, instead an Arizona based chain's recreation of the era, it seems genuine enough.

This really upset me so I contacted The Melting Pot's management and worked with the Area Manager, Kelly Cooper. Kelly was extremely helpful, and offered us a free dinner for the trouble we went through. \n\nLast night we took up the offer and arrived on time for our reservation. I requested for a table in the main dinning area, rather than one of the private booths. I never considered myself someone uncomfortable in small spaces but I really didn't like the private booths the last time we were there. The booth and area seemed very clean and much more comfortable this time around.\nOur server was extremely personable and courteous the entire evening. Everything came out promptly and we were able to dine just under the two hour mark. I've seen others complain about how long it takes to dine here but that's really just part of the experience. Plus my boyfriend and I can sit and talk for hours so we were fine with it.\n\nThe food was...okay. We had the spinach artichoke dip, which honestly was bland. We LOVE spinach artichoke dips and this was the worst one we've experienced. It lacked flavor; it needed more spices or even some kick with jalapenos. We had the Coq Au Vin broth for the entree and again it didn't really give the food much flavor at all. Our meal wasn't awful but it wasn't amazing either. As stated in my previous review I've been to The Melting Pot before and remembered how my entire family felt the food didn't match the large price you paid. I still feel the same, I dont think the food has really improved and maybe its because you're cooking it yourself. For example, we really love beef at medium rare, which you can't really do here especially since you're mixing meats and everything needs to be cooked all the way through. We love veggies steamed or roasted and well seasoned but that's not how its cooked. Without the different dipping sauces the food tastes pretty plain. It's just boiled meats and veggies, and after the boiling process the meats come out over cooked for our taste, and the veggies just seemed so boring. Also one thing I noticed, the mushrooms weren't washed; they still had that dark soil-dirt all over them. So for each one I was trying to brush off the dirt before putting them in the broth.\nFor our dessert we chose the s'more chocolate and opted to take out the brownies, cheesecake, and marshmallows, and had them add extra of everything else. Those three treats are just way too sweet to be dipped in chocolate; the sweet chocolate is more balanced by less sweet items like the fruit, pound cake, and surprisingly, the rice krispies treats.\n\nWe had a good enough time, so why is there still a low star rating? Well just under an hour after we left we both became extremely ill. I'm not exactly sure why because we followed our servers instructions by letting the meats boil for at least 2 minutes and sometimes our pieces ended up boiling longer while we had some of the veggies. Also, we didn't touch any of the raw meats to our plates either. So, we spent all last night in and out of the bathroom. Not exactly how we wanted to spend our Friday night. After some light research on Google I did find quite a few reviews on other sites, blog posts, and forum comments about people getting food poisoning from The Melting Pot.\n\nSo needless to say, this will be our last visit. After the previous bad experiences, having employees angrily contacting me, and now food poisoning we're not planning on going back. The only reason I upped the star rating is because the manager, Kelly, was so understanding with my complaints and took my concerns seriously.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FOfhEC6rN23RQaUlsR2byw"}

The bread seemed a bit bland, but the side caesar salad I ordered with my meal was tasty enough.  The pasta, however was completely different than I remember it.  It was bland, nearly tasteless and the chicken tasted like it came out of one of those microwaveable bags you buy at the deli at the grocery store that has pre-cooked bags of chicken to throw into salads.  Fake chicken? Bland pasta sauce? Bland bread? Not what I remembered from this place.  Definitely not worth the $38 we spent for the meal and I will not be returning ever again.

The atmosphere was reminiscent of my childhood hangouts. The pizza was descent. \nYou may be thinking, \"Descent? Fours stars for 'decent'?\" \nWell, let me explain. \n\n17 years ago, I was ripped from the pizza haven that was my first home (after the womb, but just as comfortable), Long Island, NY. The reasons are unclear to me still. I was a vulnerable nine year old uprooted and moved to the cruel and often cold (metaphorically, not literally) Sonoran Desert, I had no way to cope with my new surroundings. Oreos just did not fill the void in my empty pit of a stomach, which I was quickly trying to fill with something familiar. \nThat something familiar was a good, thin and crunchy crust, extra sauce, light on the cheese, pie. Pizza pie. \nNo one could provide for me. I was desolate. Pizza places came and went. A sauce here, a sauce there. \n\nEventually I learned to cope on my own without the crutch that was the perfect slice. I live for my semi annual trips back to the pizza- womb that is Greenwich Village, but when I am feeling just a little nostalgic, just a little emotional... a slice from Buono's will suffice. \n\nAnd that is why I give 4 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "m3O2EFVs3eo8s40MGGzmsA"}

The place was clean with a number of useless aquaria, meaning that they were not attractive, not kept properly and scum had accumulated on the glass.  The purpose of an aquarium is to bring some beauty to the surroundings.  This was not the case but the least of this restaurant's problems.  \nThe pricing was rather inexpensive and was surprised that the lunch combinations included 3 choices plus fried rice for 5.89.  Crazy, right?  I ordered the pork chow mein, vegetable egg foo yung & an egg roll as my choices to be accompanied with fried rice.  My eating partner just had an egg drop soup.  It took a while for the orders to come so I took that as a sign that everything was freshly prepared.  \nThe orders came in styrofoam containers.  My pork chow mein was a 2 on a scale of 5, the vegetarian egg foo yung came as a hockey puck so I would say it is also a 2, the egg roll was small (that's Ok) with veggies.  It was not over fried.  The fried rice that came with the dish was inedible---hard grains of rice stuck together.  You had to put a fork in it to dislodge the grains.  I did not eat it.  I ate what I could of the combination keeping in mind that I had only paid $5.89 for it.  The egg drop soup looked gelatinous--full of corn starch, but the person eating it said it was not bad. Does that also mean not good?  \nThe woman who took our order and our payment never came by to ask how the food was which to me is an indicator that a restauranteur takes his/her  business seriously.  You certainly want customer feedback.  I would not have been cruel but instead made constructive suggestions.  I still don't understand why they give a choice of 3 items for the combos.  That is taxing on the cook--making 3 dishes for each lunch ordered UNLESS, UNLESS... it is all pre-prepared and all he is doing is re-heating it on the wok.  Just thinking.... \nAnyway, this is NOT a place where I will ever be seen again.  I usually give restaurants a second go round, but I cannot do it here.  The food is just too sub-par. Frankly, I don't know how they stay in business.  \n If this restaurant had been really good, I would have driven from home (13 miles away) to eat here--that's how loyal I am to a good restaurant.  \nStay away folks.... there is nothing here that you want.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bxToHIsD37NjEsW_eE92mA"}

Those situations get 4, 3 and 5 stars respectively which averages out to a solid 4-stars.\n\nThe food has been consistent all around.  It's much better than the Mexican drive-thru's, not quite as good as Globe food, but pleasing with no surprises around any corners.  \n\nHappy hour and the dining room have completely different atmospheres and service.  The dining room was a typical Mexican food restaurant feel, with decent service. It was quiet and the tall booths make it easy to forget about other tables nearby.  The bar (the only place you can get happy hour deals) is loud, crowded, hectic and has had questionable service.  Not horrendous, but I think the servers are stretched too thin.  Getting refills on drinks that come with free refills seems to be a recurring issue... getting a second beer or margarita is not.  The happy hour appetizer menu is hefty enough to serve as dinner, which makes for a good cheap meal!  I'll put up with the bar environment for 3 tacos for $4.\n\nI cannot say enough good things about the private event I attended here...the disclaimer is that I didn't organize it, so I don't know how the back end was.  My future in-laws planned our rehearsal dinner the night before our wedding, and Valle Luna proved to be a perfect venue.  We were out on the patio, right on the water.  It was mid-April so the weather was perfect. The set-up was functional.  Everybody loved the food.  All props to the decorating go to my mother in-law, but Valle Luna was on top of their game with service, ID'ing the appropriate parties, and making the whole event appear seamless to the nervous bride.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NYIyTj2AZJpAo7XIM-Z7lw"}

Everyone at our table (we were a table of 20) was very happy with their meals....The chips and salsa were really good too!! (I usually judge a restaurant such as this by their chips and salsa...) I ended up having a salad with cheese and whatnot removed, and salsa for dressing, as most of the dressings also had dairy in them......\n\nService was SUPERB!

I love the creativity in something so often overlooked by most restaurants.  \n\nI've been here twice and had a great experience both times.  The first time I got the Italia Salad.  It was very large with lots of meat and cheese.  It was very tasty.  I followed that up by an ice cream sandwich which was at least 4x too big for me.  The cookie was fresh and warm with the ice cream wedged in between.  I say that baby is fit for 2 large adults or 3-4 people that know their limit.\n\nThe 2nd time I got the Italia sandwich.  It was fantastic.  The potato salad I chose as a side was good too.  Too often places overcook the hell out of the potatoes and it turns into mush.  Theirs still had some texture which was nice.  It was a very satisfying meal.  We chased our dish with their signature espresso which is a micro latte (two baby lattes). \n\nI love the uniqueness of the original brick wall, and the exposed wooden trusses that make up the roof.  Even the seemingly simple light bulbs are unique with a hoop-earring looking filament within them.  They have a brick oven for pizzas and a huge display for those tempting deserts.  In addition to the espresso bar they also have a nice selection of beer and wine.  This is a great lunch spot in an area of town not known for independent and unique dining options.  \n\nWorth the drive from Tempe.

All of the bells and whistles were included: cart, range balls of higher quality, 10 minute tee times, outside service personnel who were attentive and knowledgeable, rangers who were NOT intrusive, food and beverage services that were well above average, 30,000 square feet of clubhouse with all of the amenities found in a private club (even though it was and is a daily fee, they still catered to a very limited number of members, mostly through the Troon corporate shell) and a pro shop that was slammed with high-end hard and soft goods logoed with the Troon North Horned Toad. It was the quintessential desert golf experience this side of Palm Springs and, at the time, had no real rivals. \n\nFast forward to today: Gone are the $295 advance tee-times; now there is the Monument Express. They have \"created\" an executive course that can be played quite quickly in the afternoons (I remember when, in the summer, they would simply close off tee-times after 12:30). The service is much lower quality as are the course conditions and that certainly is dictated by an economy that has taken a large dump on the golf industry in general. Weiskopf-Morrish designs are brilliant things, multiple tees allow all level of players opportunities to enjoy their courses. And the Pinnacle and Monument courses still stand up from an architectural point of view. But these are no longer days of wine and roses - just look north and east a bit and recognize that what was perhaps AS GOOD a design by Tom Doak at Apache Stronghold in Globe no longer even exists. Executive courses made to be played in a quick time frame, created by sticking tee markers in the ground at various distances and angles is not an indice of great golf. \n\nIt's an indicator of: Good Lord, how do we generate more revenue without throwing up the third finger on the downward plunge... Lower pricing for locals not just in low season but in both shoulder and HIGH season may be a way to find that lost revenue stream. Troon Cards are all fine and good.

The last straw was the salmon roll which was, again, a california roll topped with baked chopped salmon.  It was inedible.  I couldn't understand why there were so many customers there.  I wouldn't eat here again if it were free.  I wish I had really listened to Mar A.'s review.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gqLWBFxOKag8dXwVxEvTrg"}

The management might want to save money during the winter but who wants to come into a restaurant that requires a jacket for warmth?  Even after requesting more heat two different times, it never came.  The bartender was the server and she didn't hide her ambivalent attitude toward her job.  I'm not sure that I blame her for that.\n\nThe pizza was also a complete rip off (go to Papa John's if you want pizza)!  The crust was as thin as paper and the proportion of cheese to pizza sauce was about 1 to 5.  The food echoed a desire of shareholders to up the profit margin.  After all, for most of their items, there is a reason why they offer the big portions that they do - it obviously allows them to reduce expenses (staff, energy, itemized purchases) and increase profit by serving in bulk under the guise that it is an \"Italian\" thing to have large portions to share.  If you've ever been to Italy, you know that they all don't eat according to such a model!\n\nThe Mozzarella Caprese is good though, and can almost be a meal for two when coupled with the complimentary bread.

It's simply a bar/dining room in Vegas... and that's not a bad thing. It's very much the neighborhood spot; you see a lot of the same faces and that's quite pleasant.\n\nThe staff is friendly and usually very fast. They pay attention, they get to know you and what you like, and they let me change the channel when I want to watch sports. :)\n\nThe bar is large and has different seating areas apart from the bar itself: you can sit in the booths along the wall or in two different table areas and still have access to everything. They also offer some pool tables along the back wall. Great for sports and events, though it can be quite loud and hard to have a conversation. \n\nThe food is good. Not amazing, but solidly good. From breakfast to salads to the \"typical\" bar/appetizer menu to a tasty picatta, they serve you a decent meal with a smile. The chicken wings are a step above good and definitely a must-have late night or while watching the game with friends.\n\nAn inexpensive but ultimately drinkable wine list and crisp salads make this an easy choice for lunch with friends or coworkers. \n\nThe full menu is available in the bar, and the full bar is available in the dining room. That's always a good thing.\n\nThere's also a meeting room/private dining room if you need it.

I was short on time, had a 40 minutes lunch break and since Island- style was right across the stress, I was thinking 35 mins should be plenty of time to eat my food and leave. I was waiting over 20 mins for my food and I understand there were a few orders ahead of me and by looking at everyone else's food, it does take time to cook. After 15mins passed by I asked the guy if it would take long cause I only had 15 mins left to eat and go back. He did said he would check on it then left. Approx 10 more minutes passed by I gave him my credit card so it would be faster if I ate and left. He told me that it takes time to make my buckwheat noodles and that everything was made to order. Ughhh.... buddy I'm Korean and I know damn well that it only takes 30 secs once in boiling water to cook the noodles and put in the broth. Needless to say I took one bite of the cold noodle and it wasn't hand made, it was the store bought noodles you cook in boiling water. The broth was so salty, and the spicy buckwheat noodles tasted like pure hot pepper paste + vinegar and again salty. I took literally two bites and left. The guy who took my order grabbed the checkbook from me and told customers next to me 'shes telling me how to cook brah...'. I know you've been cooking for 19 years BUT if you knew anything about customer service you do not talk shit when I can clearly hear you, grab the checkbook out of my hand, and give me dirty looks.

The whole place looked nice and all the stations from the drinks to the salsa bar was clean and well presented. I ordered the Baja Chicken and brought my refill \"to-go\" cup to use for 99 cents. It's so useful and I like the idea that I'm saving a cup every time I use it. :D Plus I refill it again before I head out, so I can replenish myself whenever I need it. It's definitely a win-win situation. I even brought half of my sweetened green tea home and put in the fridge for later and it was still so refreshing to drink it. Almost like a cold dessert! I also used a previous receipt survey coupon that gives me $2 off from spending $8. All you have to do to get this is go online and complete a quick survey on your dining experience. Then you are given a code at the end, which you use toward your next purchase. This can be done every time you dine there. Sweet deal right?!??! I like it A lot.\n\nI went to the restroom to wash my hands after ordering and it was spotless clean. The salsa bar is the first thing I checkout and this time there was a new salsa of the season.... Cranberry Salsa!!! It had diced celery, onion, cranberry, and bits of cilantro.   When my order was ready, I cut the Baja Chicken Burrito in half and put some of this new salsa on top... took the first bite and the flavors exploded with freshness. It seriously had this perfect combination of a healthy meal. You start to understand why  their philosophy is \"Live Fresh.\" The more I ate this scrumptious burrito, the more I tasted all the high quality ingredients and freshness from it. The soft flour tortilla tasted so delicious from having it slightly grilled and it's almost like they brushed it with rich light butter. It's like eating a butter cookie without all the sugar added to it. However they grilled this burrito, it tasted oh so yummy! The Cranberry Salsa gives this burrito the ultimate whammy of renewed vows of love. Eating this together and you have the Burrito of a Lifetime. I swear I went by to the salsa bar over six times to refill my cup!!! And it's not because I was a few steps away, but it was that good to keep going back for more. Simply the best tasting, healthy burrito I have devoured. I even licked my fingers to taste the salsa that was dripping down the burrito from over pouring. Can you imagine how fun this experience was?!! Keep imagining... Until you get down and dirty like me.. you really don't know what fun is at Baja Fresh. But you know it's good when it's messy and you don't even care. I even added a chunk of cilantro in the Cranberry Salsa and it was a swimming beautiful, green garden in that sauce. I am a Huge fan!!!\n\nEven their complimentary tortilla chips were served in a paper bag and it wasn't even oily at all! No oil stain whatsoever on the paper bag and that's so great to see. Even the chips taste healthy and good!!! \n\nOn their site, it's noted that all of their entr\u00e9es are made with all natural, hormone free, fire-grilled Chicken, Steak, and slow-roasted Carnitas. And they serve only fresh guacamole and famous salsas made with locally grown, farm fresh produce!!! \n\nAfter I ate everything.. I felt like I could conquer the world!!! Energized and ready to get my shopping on. I was feeling so Alive and recharged! \n\nI'm having a real addiction to their fresh produce and you can tell that everything is made by hand. You know where I'll be on my day off.... spending a night here! :P", "type": "review", "business_id": "kAlR7X4jiDPZdISJAAKkmg"}

We are seated and start looking through the menu. \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty big. It has a lively atmosphere with 1 flatscreen TV. They have a decent selection of beer which was cool. We end up ordering the basics wich were Honey Walnut Prawns, Pan Fried Noodles with beef, and fried rice. Huge portions which was prefect since I was starving.\n\nEveything tasted great. No complaints from us whatsoever. No we were not drunk, so our taste buds were definitely not decieving us. The walnut prawns were addicting, and had to have a fork fight with the wife to grab the last one. She won.\n\nOur waiter was great the entire time. Wich of course he should, being as it was empty.\n\nI would love to comeback and try some of the other dishes.\n\nSo if your having a late night craving, or just a craving for for Chinese grub in general, don' hesitate to stop by this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg"}

Why did we wait outside so long? We waited another 17 minutes and our server never came to our table! I went and found the manager and told him that we've been waiting for way too long and we have no utensils and no server to take our order. The manager was really sweet and took our order at that moment and had the busboy bring us utensils. We ate half of our meal before the waiter (Francisco according to our receipt) finally came by and placed down the onion rings. He did not introduce himself, we asked if he was our server and he rudely said yes and then left.

I order something off the regular menu burrito and enchilada plate. The lengua thought was ok. They were generous with the amount of protein always good thing in life! It comes with refried beans and chips. The refried beans for me just plain and not very good. It was little more chunkier then normal spots go too when get my taco fix. Just felt like no real flavor too them. The lengua tacos were good but nothing special. The combination plate the enchilada was just that nothing special and the sauce could have had more flavor. Burrito it was OK. Nothing skimpy about it. It packed with shredded meat with some onions and green bell peppers. The meat was moist and overall ok nothing that wowed me. Really the general theme through out my whole meal felt was OKKKK. The price you pay is very reasonable and portion size get your money worth.

Made sure to have plenty of time, arrived early to enjoy the lake so here goes...\n\nConcept - Wine Store with a twist. After arriving early and walking around the store for a few minutes we were seated on the patio with one of us having our backs to the lake, they quickly reseated us down by the small man made creek and the setting was perfect.\n\nService - Our waiter was terrific and didn't rush us, he knew we were there to relax and not be rushed.\n\nWine - They add $10 to any bottle of wine you purchase and drink there. I grabbed a nice $40 bottle to start and Marche was starting to live up to it's name...boy was this going to be a great night...\n\nAppetizer - Plate of pate, cheeses, candied walnuts and a few other french delicacies and we were in the land of the sublime. Not a tourist in sight, just us locals enjoyed a lovely evening, feeling very far from the lights of the Strip.\n\nWine - Second bottle is opened and awaiting Shrimp & Grits for my better half and Duck for myself..Oh boy this is going to be so good and I just feel the 5 star review I am going to put on YELP!\n\nOMG tell me it isn't so....\n\nDinner - AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER!\n\nMost likely the roughest, grittiest Grits I have ever tasted. Shrimp had no flavor at all. The Chef was obviously not in the kitchen when this came out or he/she didn't taste prior plating. On the other hand the presentation of the dish along with the the general flavor maybe the Chef is just tasteless.\n\nDuck is one of my favorite meals, done medium rare it's flavors and complexity can match any dish in the world. 3 things went wrong here:\n\n1) The duck itself came our cold and I mean COLD. After returning twice, for exactly the same thing the third plate was actually the second plate microwaved...You have to be kidding me!!!!\n\n2) It came with the most god awful stuffing mix that was bland, flavorless with no color at all. This stuff would not even have made a BAD Thanksgiving table.\n\n3) Presentation was deplorable. No flare, just basic plates that weren't even warmed prior to plating, Really very disappointing indeed.\n\nSo we basically gave up on the dinner and asked for the check. Everything was still on there at full price, duck, grits, wine you name it. No managers effort to come over and offer to comp a dinner, take off the bottling charge, offer desert, absolutely nothing at all.\n\nThe bill was over $150, I tipped the waiter cash and asked him to present the check to management with my sincere disappointment. Upon leaving not a comment or thanks for coming.\n\nSo what appeared to start of as a new favorite place to go for date night will have a distinctly difficult time getting us back for a second try. Maybe a bottle of wine and cheese plate on a nice afternoon but as for dinner they need to really be careful or they will be back to being a wine store and deli.\n\nSorry Marche, you need some help.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lqx--hrRwe0oK6WnFYNXlg"}

Their wings are simply amazing. You can order all drumsticks if you want for like 10 cents each. The wait can be a little long, but the service is typically decent.\n\nThe Mad Onion restaurant inside is open 24 hours & they have some great deals, but the service is shotty & the wait can be FOREVER. They say they make the same wings as the restaurant, but they don't taste like them at all.

My friend did, at the end of the stay, talked to the front desk about getting the Resort Fee taken off because our internet didn't work in the room and was successful in doing so. \n\nThe casino downstairs is very small, The dealers (dressed like the Hooter girls you see in the restaurants) are fun and make it a fun place to play on a small budget. They do have a $3 Blackjack table, which as the one and only $3 table can be hard to get to sit down on especially on a weekend.\n\nAs a frequent visitor to Vegas, I won't be staying here again anytime soon, but if it was my only option, it's not too bad.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KJnVuzpveyDrHARVNZaYVg"}

There's a good amount of sauce, not too much cheese (yes there is such a thing, crazy I know), and a crust that is thin and crispy but flavorful.  Their pizza is slightly salty in a good way and the sauce is savory with a slight sweetness that compliments the salty cheese well.  It's worth the extra mile or so and few extra bucks for this pizza than from my regular neighborhood joint.  Another plus is there's outdoor seating, nothing fancy but on a beautiful night it's nice to not eat at home or in an oven of a pizza galley.

My daughter got so frustrated with him she finally asked the manager to change our server. I will go back, but will refuse service by Jamil.

In a nutshell, The Penguin was opened in 1954 by a man I'll call \"Mr B\". Around 10 years ago, two guys - Brian and Jimmy - took over the restaurant from Mr B, who has since died. Brian and Jimmy hired Greg to be head chef, and the \"new\" Penguin was a smash hit. However, when Brian and Jimmy's lease was up for renewal, Mr B's family decided to kick them out and hire Martin Sprock to turn it into a franchise.\n\nBut how's the food? Sadly, a shadow of its former self. The fried pickles, once the star of the show, are greasy and soggy, and not nearly as good as before. I ordered the \"Freak Flag Fly\", a burger with queso, bacon and slaw, and was bitterly disappointed. The meat was dry and overdone, and flavor was... lacking. My fries were way too cool (almost cold) and lacked salt. My GF's onion rings were entirely too \"bready\", not like the delicious ones I remember from before. For the record, the new menu is actually larger than the previous menu. But one wonders why they should have a bigger menu if they can't even get basics like fries and rings right. And I also wonder why it took so long to get our food when there were only three other occupied tables at 7PM on a Thursday night.\n\nWhat's worse is that the ambiance is totally gone. It's still the same building, but the servers lack tattoos. The jukebox, once one of the most eclectic in Charlotte, is now Top 40. They even sell souvenirs now! It's like a Disney-fied version of the restaurant I once knew and loved! \n\nIf you want to have the same food that made the Penguin such a success in the first place, try The Diamond next door (Brian and Jimmy's new place) or Pinky's Westside (Greg's new place). Both are delicious and authentic. The \"new\" Penguin is neither.", "type": "review", "business_id": "d3-h8QpXoQnUlC9nt55HTw"}

Kind of annoying, but we were willing to be patient even though we were starving (note, we came here post-half marathon, so we may have been a little hangry).\n\nWe found 4 stools at the bar, and the customers at the bar were willing to shuffle a little to let us sit down there, but once we sat down, the waitress behind the bar told us that the group at one of the booths were leaving and we could sit there.  We sat, and the other waitress came over and scolded us for sitting! The other group that \"was in front of us\" was nowhere to be found, otherwise we would have just stayed at the bar.\n\nWe ordered. Then waited. And waited. And waited. Over an hour and a half passed, and we still had no food, no apps. We all ordered water to drink, so that's  all we had, The only good part is that the waitress did come refill our waters fairly regularly. We watched a few other tables get their food, only to see that the order was completely wrong, and one table just left money for their apps and left after 2 wrong orders served.\n\nFinally, we called the waitress over so we could ask about how much longer it would be, since we were starving! She said she had no idea, and didn't even offer to check to see if our orders had been started. She just offered to cancel them, so we did and left.\n\nSo, hugely disappointing.

As someone who tries to eat semi-healthy and likes variety with my meal, this is the ideal place. And it's pretty affordable, in the $8-$10 range.\n\nThe main event here is chicken, with a bit of a latin twist. You can go the traditional Southern route with both how you get your rotisserie and the sides you choose. I like a little flavor kick, so I went with the Chicken and Black Bean combo, served over rice with that tangy jaco sauce. If you want to splurge calorically a bit, you can get the same thing with queso.\n\nYou can go sandwich style, or go for the platter. The platter is a great value, as it comes with cornbread and your choice of endless sides. You can sub in some tortillas if you want to tilt your meal further to the South.\n\nThere are many tasty sides, including mac and cheese, greens and many other staples. I went with the garlicky new potatoes and the special stir fry mix of vegetables, which included broccoli and squash. The veggies were fresh, and the potatoes were creamy. It will probably take a long time before you can try out every side here, but I really don't think you can wrong with any combo.\n\nI like the fact that you order up front, and they yell out your name when it's ready, and be warned, the food gets ready fast. The only question with seating was the lighting, but then again, I think we kind of picked a bad spot and could have moved to a more open area. The soft drinks are only $1.25, and it's easy access for refills of soda. As someone who loves to experiment with sauces, I really dig the fresh salsa bar. That pico de gallo is spicy and excellent.\n\nOverall, this is a great place.

But unfortunately, just based on food alone, this dinner deserved the low rating. \n\nThe restaurant had a 45 minute wait on a Friday night, so we got a large Margherita pizza and some chicken parmesan to go.  We tore into the paper bags and the pizza box, and to our surprise...the pizza had completely MELTED.  We hadn't tipped the box or shifted it in-transit at all.  It was flat and pretty still sitting on the floor of the car.\n\nCheese was everywhere. \n\nOil was seeping from the box.\n\nNot just a little oil seepage, but the Exxon-Valdez had just spilled and permeated the box.  That takes a heck-uv-a lot of oil to penetrate a thick corrugated pizza box. \n\nI was starving, and ate two of the massive slices.  They weren't bad...I mean the flavor was there (this is not really all that authentic tasting...since there was no fresh mozz on the pie at all) but again, my mouth was coated in grease after each bite, and honestly, had I not been so hungry, I would have thrown it all away. \n\nActually, after that, we threw everything away. \n\nAs for the chicken parm, we were underwhelmed.  It was forgettable.  No distinct flavor, just the standard chicken parm. The breadstick that was just leftover dough, twisted into a shape and baked.  It could have passed for a bloated pizza crust. \n\nI could knock on it..like knock-knock-breadstick...\n\nThe salad, was equally as weak.  Romaine lettuce, red onion rings, shredded carrots, green olives...there was nothing special about this salad.  In fact, it was a bit wet as if someone didn't spin the salad spinner long enough after washing.  The dressing one Yelper called \"amazing\"-- was a creamy orange nothing.  It added nothing to the salad. \n\nGAHH!  I'm so mad at this meal...just writing about it makes me frustrated! \n\nThe price, over $30 with tax...and frankly, after I told my co-workers, two of them said \"Why did you go there?\"--one guy said the pizza was made from a pre-formed pizza shell.  (Not sure if this is true...) Another woman told me, for the money, you could get TWO pizzas at another joint 5 minutes away. \n\nSigh.  I'd like to be fair and try this place again...but after the oil slick in my stomach right now, I think I'd rather not.", "type": "review", "business_id": "toIpqgcjG0HhPHZCMiHH3Q"}

Let me start by saying, if you're eating in - don't order anything with a soup as a side... everyone gets a complimentary cup of soup, and you end up with a bag of chips/pretzels with your half sandwich/etc. \n\nI ordered one of the club sandwiches, no mayo. I received the club with mayo, without tomato. Actually a ridiculous amount of mayo. My lunch partner ordered a half sandwich with soup. Not only was that pointless (for a moment we were expecting a possible double soup - especially since it was super tasty that day - um, stuffing croutons??) But then the sandwich was served cut all sorts of wrong. There were actually crust pieces on both sides of the sandwich (frankly I'm not even sure how this happened, but imagine a standard half of a sandwich and your top piece of bread has the standard two-sided crust and then a cut edge side, but then underneath there was a two-sided crustless piece with a long crusted edge... yeah, so no soft crustless first bite). Both of our sandwiches had a large percentage of the sliced meat bundled in the middle, so the edge pieces were really just mayo and bread, but I could overlook that in the future.\n\nI like that they give you a small jug to refill your own drink with, but at the same time I feel like it became an excuse to never check in besides bringing the food and the check. At one point I though about asking for a sliced tomato, since I would have really liked one on my sandwich, but our server couldn't be found. I could tell plenty of people had built great relationships with certain servers, but we (and a few other tables) seemed to be at a loss when it came to any help. \n\nMy sandwich was not anything spectacular, and I know I can make the same at the closer to me Laurel Market (barely a price difference and I know it's going to come out exactly how I ordered it) but the idea of surprise daily soups are appealing and the monthly specials sounded good, so I might find myself in BB&M again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "82pWLAlsrdpKu8tVS2yJKw"}

Wasn't really blown away like I was every previous time I had gone here. I know the owners switched but I really hoped the new people understood that they inherited near Supper Club perfection. I don't think they did. . . \n\nAt first the changes were subtle. The atmosphere was the same. Old Wisconsin Supper Club. We went mid-week so the lack of a crowd wasn't too much of a surprise - although every time before it had quite a few people in there no matter when we went. \n\nThen we looked at the menu. Seemed like that changed the most. Just didn't have the same items and seemed to be very trimmed down - except for the prices. Those seemed to go up and the level of sophistication with the dishes too. This is fine, but totally not needed at the old Avenue.\n\nThe wife and I both got steaks. They were ok - but a bit overdone, a little tough and nothing amazing. This was a disappointment as we were used to that 'why don't we come here more often' feeling in the past. \n\nService was still decent although I got a Brandy Old Fashion from the bar - and apparently those changed too.

Although the menu is large they do not deviate from the regular breakfast fare much... If you are expecting something drastically different you might be disappointed.  I love sitting on the patio.. enjoying the weather, having a cup off coffee and fresh squeezed OJ and whatever breakfast entree I choose.   The prices are reasonable and the service is always good... what more can you ask for?", "type": "review", "business_id": "4meJyPOhuAKzywUJTmu2hw"}

Restroom counter needed to be wiped down.  Employees were warm and friendly.\n\nMy one whole-wheat pancake with glazed pecans took 15 minutes to arrive, which I thought was a little too long, but it did look like there were many diners at that time.  I've had better-looking pancakes at this location before (as in wider portions), so this morning's platter was disappointing (please read my review of Dobson location and refer to photo for size comparison).

There is a line of spaces in the back of building maybe holds a good to 12 cars against a 3 ft brick wall right by the alley. Don't let the location chase you away.  The building itself is cute lined with arched beautiful windows. When you walk in you can seat yourself someone will come to you and take your order.  The inside is nicely decorated with typical Mexican decor Pancho Villa pictures and all. Not overly done but tastefully done. You will be served fresh hot chips with mmm mmm salsa. I bit spicy maybe for the weak but still full of flavor. We had an excellent waitress and she made sure our basket and salsa was always full along with our drinks. Water is not tap lol so that was nice I was a bit thirsty so didn't mind the refills. We ordered the platter with seafood for 2 you get a salad Mexican potatoes and rice. The platter was abundant with several tasty items sea bass grilled and breaded. Shrimp grilled AND lightly breaded and bacon wrapped and to top off a lobster tail. It truly was alot we definitely could not finish. If you ever are in the area and would like some authentic Mexican dishes stop by Rita's.

I have ordered online from them many times. I am the kind of person who is willing to pay more for good quality and I don't mind a wait either. In fact I am an ideal customer, who rarely complains. Tonight was terrible!! I ordered my dinner through the website a little early, because I know it usually takes an hour or so for the food to arrive, though I am only 2 blocks away. My order was supposed to arrive at 6:30. At 7:15 I decided to give them a call to make sure there were no issues. The girl who answered the phone assured me that my order had just left. So we waited. At 8:10 I had my significant other call, and he was informed not only did they have no order for me, but that in fact their computer had just happened to break today. So the 60.00 I was charged through their personal website was not even on record. On asking to speak with a manager we were informed that only she and a cook were there, no manager on site. So there was no way to get my money back until I spoke with this higher up? Don't get me wrong I have a decent amount of money in my account, but 60.00 is nothing to scoff at. It's too late now to order pizza anywhere else, since we waited all night for this order that didn't go through. I am not even upset really about the order messing up, I mean things happen. I am super mad about the fact that I was blatantly lied to, when I could have made different accommodations for my evening other than waiting for food that never came.. Someone can use some training on customer service- NEVER LIE, especially if you aren't going to come through for the person!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YBVQik4ySvAlvxobuFcXDA"}

The sauce on the chicken was the highlight of my meal - creamy, garlicky, full of flavor.  The chicken underneath was moist, and the accompanying relish was quite tasty.

And there is a little bit of grease that floats up from the meat and cheese that you can mop up with your bread.  Hey, I *walked* to the restaurant, right?\n\nThe Carpaccio is also good and I have not had the pizza, but it looked and smelled delicious.  We will be back in Scottsdale next month and I'm already dreaming about that creamy and delicious lasagna!", "type": "review", "business_id": "k6Si433-EJrY4J7SZxsnjA"}

I like wings, I always have.  The spicier the better, and finding wings that have that right amount of burn and flavor is hard to find.  Some places like to make their wings so hot that they sacrifice flavor for the prestige of being the hottest wings in the neighborhood, while some places have wings with all the right flavor, but you feel like a complete wimp for the lack of pain that you just consumed.  Zipps on Camelback is one of the those burn before flavor places, but only barely.\n\nI heard about their \"hot\" wings, and scoffed at the idea of a trendy sports bar being able to cook my tongue with their sauce properly.  The waitress, a cute little number, came to us and took our order and I, being cocky and maybe somewhat stupid, told her to get my wings from the bottom of the barrel.  I didn't think they would exact some sick form of revenge on me for my boisterous dare.  I was wrong.\n\nThe wings came out in a good time, considering it was the early part of St Patrick's Day and they were a little busy.  As soon as they hit the table, my nose was filled with spicy aroma of habanero and vinegar, a good wing combination.  My grandfather, who smartly ordered tacos, looked at me like a priest reading rites to a death row inmate, smiled and wished me luck.  The first wing wasn't too bad.  I felt a little ting and smiled as I sucked it down.  Then I felt a little fire on the lips.  It was only slightly painful, but very managable.  I took the second wing in earnest, and bit down with the same defiant determination as the first.  More burn, but not too bad.  Around wings five, six and seven, I my head started to bead up.  Wings nine and ten, I was in full water sucking mode.\n\nI didn't finish the wings...sadly a first for me.  I did take them home, thinking that they would be a great second day food.  Overall, I really liked the atmosphere.  I sat outside, so my addiction to cigarettes would be fulfilled, and my love of baseball was satisfied by the multiple big screens that surrounded the wooden tables and benches.  Service was top notch, and thank God the cups were huge (and filled with water).\n\nI would recommend Zipps on Camelback because it is a good atmosphere and there is plenty of scenery in the female variety to look at.  The wings were good, not great.  Hot, but a little flavor was lost in the heat of it all.  My grandfather, a huge fan of tacos, raved about them, so I would trust them enough to go back and give them a whirl.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hGQsnkndreW7b26XC2HVRA"}

While it was nice, again, to be on the winning side of the day's golf and therefore receiving a free meal I didn't walk out feeling like a winner.  The service is still very attentive and the place is cool to see but the food is at best average.  The cuts of meat were marginal, not bad but nothing special at all, and were cooked inconsistently and not always to order.  In general it just came across as a novelty experience - lots of sports memorabilia eye candy with food as a secondary consideration.  We were a big group last year and an even bigger one this year but I'm pretty sure there won't be a next year for us at D&C.\n\nFirst posted 5/14/07---\nThis is a 3.5 star rating.  At times I find myself adding points for one aspect only to deduct some for an entirely different reason.  I guess that makes this place a bit of an enigma to me.  I am left thinking of it as a classic throwback blue-collar sports bar B.B.Q.-joint diner steakhouse with an interesting atmosphere.\n\nI was in the Scottsdale area as part of a group of 12 guys on an annual golf outing and this was the third and final dinner of the trip and served as the high priced ($40/guy) loss for the losing team (of which I unfortunately was a member).\n\nThe food was good - they definitely know how to cook meat.  I had the 12 oz. filet and it was cooked exactly as the waitress described medium rare - pink and warm in the middle.  The guys sitting on either side of me each ordered different steaks cooked to different levels and both seemed equally satisfied.  I also really enjoyed my iceberg wedge salad - it was huge and fresh - but that shouldn't be hard to get right.  My double baked potato was fine and desserts were at best average.  I had the flourless chocolate cake which was fine but the banana cream pie was essentially whipped cream on top of banana pudding.\n\nThe atmosphere was not exactly what I expected although I didn't really know what to expect.  When I think 'steakhouse' I think two things.  First is a somewhat dark dining area with booths and a sort of intimate feel to it and second is a menu that features various steak/prime rib cuts along with token chicken, fish and pasta selections.  Don & Charlie's is none of this.  Then again it is not strictly a steakhouse.  The dining area is essentially one big, brightly lit room with no booths and a fairly loud din.  It, along with virtually every part of the building, is covered with sports memorabilia.  The menu is broad enough that you actually have to look for the steak section.  Being there for the reason I was made these variances a positive to me but on other occasions they could just as easily have been a negative\n\nRandom notes:  The service was great in a very straightforward way.  With such a large group it is almost inevitable that when the food comes out there is some confusion about who ordered what.  But we experienced none of that.  People were served what they ordered and without any chaos.  Bud Selig, of \"Chopped Steak a la Bud Selig\" fame, or is it Commissioner of MLB fame, was there.  Valet parking at $5 was expensive and an out of place option given the rest of the experience.\n\nThe main thing that made me round down to 3 stars was the price.  It's just too expensive for what you get.  I didn't see the final bill but it must have been $45+/guy without drinks.  I have no problem paying that kind of money for a meal but I have had many better meals for that kind of money.  It was fun to see the sports stuff but ultimately it is about the dining experience and, on the whole, for the price it really was average.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bc-lE-wGVAsUrX-kJhtY-Q"}

Why you ask? Because where else can you carry on business dealings in a strip joint, be involved in \"waste management\", act out of control all the time, philander, defraud the government...and fit right in? But for he and many other recent transplants from Jersey, the truth is part of Scottsdale's allure rests with places like DeFalco's Italian Grocery.\n\nSitting in a worn strip mall in an older section of town, the scene almost evokes a little hint of the Garden State. However, the good news is that I've never seen anyone whacked in the spacious parking lot...or wearing a Members Only jacket for that matter. Upon entering, there's a claustrophobic sensation as you see the grocery aisles creating a slightly labyrinthine path to the deli counters, which are separate based on ordering prepared or raw food. Upon reaching the prepared food aisle, you'll invariably see a microcosm of Scottsdale, ranging from senior citizens to high schools girls using platinum cards to buy lunch for the whole family. (Luckily though, no sign of Carmine Gotti just yet.) \n\nThe menu? It's a pageant of sumptuous meats and cheeses, and they even offer I-talian soda to go with. It's so good, you might think like many a famous eatery it's a front for the local outfit. While I don't believe that to be true...(it is Arizona after all) the owners certainly make purists and old school Italian food fans happy with its inclusion of more traditional meat choices like capacollo. The food also will seem dry, but that's only because they are careful not to drown out the meat's character with too much mayo or other condiments. Some may not like it.\n\nPrice-wise, this place is pretty much a steal. It's a shade more expensive than Subway, but not much more-so. But as Scottsdale goes, it's almost unbeatable. They also accept plastic and have a loyalty card, so as you can imagine, you'll want to come back often if you know what is good for you.\n\nSince it's a deli, there's no waitstaff. Still, service is total class. People are friendly, and professional so that it still feels family-owned and not corporate. The tables are usually clean in the seating area, and spaced evenly enough that you won't feel like someone just broke your legs.\n\nBut then there is the one detraction to this place: the supposedly endless wait for your order. I've never been on a weekday, but weekends I have found are pretty manageable. For some people it won't  be like Jack-in-the-Box, but if you order ahead you should avoid some of the hassle.\n\nOf course, part of the allure going to an Italian restaurant in the cultural attitude about savoring life, food and a slower pace than our Anglo-Saxon roots ultimately prefer. Unless, that is, you have reservations to Buca di Beppo...but that's another story entirely.", "type": "review", "business_id": "z3yFuLVrmH-3RJruPEMYKw"}

I don't remember when exactly I first visited this location, but it was probably that same year or in 1995. Since then I have probably visited this particular location somewhere between 50 to 100 times. \n\nI'm really a big fan of this place because they were the first to introduce me to Mediterranean food. Beforehand, I was not familiar with words such as hummus, baba ganoosh, taboule or tsatziki. Ever since, I've been a big fan of Mediterranean food because of it's distinct flavors and healthy options.\n\nThe Pita Jungle in Tempe has evolved physically from the restaurant I remember when I was younger. It use to be only half as big as it is today. Right around 2005, they purchased the store next door and demolished the wall that divided them; thus, increasing their space to accomodate their large patronage. The parking lot they share with the small plaza they occupy, however, has not grown. Beware, the limited parking available during lunch hours on weekdays. Pita Jungle can get really packed.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is decorated with various pieces of artwork from local artists on the walls which changes every so often. The ceiling is decked with exposed ducts, which give the location a kind of industrial feel to it. Also, the servers pretty much wear everyday clothing. In all, I kinda  get a California, somewhat Bohemian-feel for the environment. Although, it's probably lost some of that in the past couple of years every since it's grown.\n\nI've tried all sorts of dishes at Pita Jungle, but my all-time favorite at this location is the Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza, When I use to work in Tempe, I frequently chose this dish. I really like all the other dishes I've tried at Pita Jungle. I guess it's just a matter of what you're in the mood for. My other recommendations if you are eating in are the Wood-fired Fresh Salmon, Spicy Mango Shrimp and Chicken Del Sol. I might point out that the Chicken Del Sol is a protein-rich dish containing chicken and beans. It's a pretty healthy serving for the low price of 6 to 8 bucks. \n\nI don't frequent this particular location like I use to. Furthermore, I've only had one bad experience at this location, but why let one bad experience put a damper on my overall long patronage. I'm kinda tempted to give it 4 stars because my tastes have differed over the years, but I don't really have anything critically negative to say about this Pita Jungle so I would be willing to give it 5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eGevCRobYnA_HSj60sEWvQ"}

We've been wanting to try this place out for some time since we live very close and heard good things from several different people. We are both glad we finally decided to go.\n\nThe menu is very diverse with many pork, chicken, beef, seafood and rice and noodle options.\n\nWe decided to order pork fried rice, beef with snow peas and moo shoo chicken along with the complimentary tea and white rice. All dishes were fresh, hot and served to us within 10 minutes of our order. We had plenty of food left over and gave me another meal today.\n\nThe pork fried rice was a little bit different from what I've grown up eating in California, but still good nonetheless. The rice was darker and had bean sprouts. The moo shoo also came pre-wrapped. Other places I've eaten ate you always filled your own pancake. Either way, I still have the food inside spill out.\n\nThe main dining room isn't especially big, but has several booths and table to sit at. \n\nThere is a small bar inside if you wish to have a drink during dinner.\n\nThere are daily lunch specials for under $7.

This is probably the first time I have been in there in maybe a dozen years.  It hasn't changed much.  The first owners tried opening Saturdays and a group of us would gather almost every week for breakfast, then it got hot in the summer and they closed Saturdays until fall and then opened Saturdays again and just about the time they built back a regular Saturday crowd it was summer again, they closed and we moved to Cocos (now bulldozed at Maryvale and Indian School.).  They are on the fourth or fifth owners now and I have had a few lunches picked up for me over the years.  Ironically two of the guys I used to go to breakfast with were there eating lunch with their parents today.\n\nWhen I first moved here in 93 an Italian pizza/pasta place had recently gone out of business at this location and the suite was vacant until the Corporate Cafe opened, IIRC, the fall of 94.\n\nThe menu is sort of eclectic with some American standards, a few Middle Eastern and a few Mexican.  Each owner seems to have added a few things to the menu and it is now about twice as many items as were on the original menu.  They are only open for breakfast and lunch and everything on the menu is available any time.  The food is ok but not great.  It is priced right for what it is.  This time I had a mushroom swiss burger ($5.75) that came with my choice of salad, fries, cole slaw, soup or potato salad and an iced tea ($1.75).  I got the salad and it is iceburg lettuce with a couple small pieces of tomato and cucumber.  The hamburger came dry with a packet of mayo and ketchup on the table.  The lettuce, tomato, sliced onions and pickles are on the side. For my taste the meat was too well done but still a bit juicy, I get the impression that is the way it would come even if I had specified something else.\n\nThe main customers are people who work in the area and quite often sales people take local clients there.  It's an industrial type place that fits pretty well in this older industrial area.  It is clean and the colors are pleasant.  Like this whole area of town it isn't as busy as it was a few years ago.", "type": "review", "business_id": "O-s2pyewnZXyyxBAfka7-A"}

In this area, there are many family run places that are authentic.  Not only did we not finish our meals, we didn't even bring them home.  I had the combo plate with a chili relleno and tamale.  The \"relleno\" was a large omelet with 2-2\" pieces of plain poblano tucked inside then covered with way too much cheese (I guess so that you couldn't tell that it was an omelet?).  The tamale was an extremely thick coating of masa with very dry meat.  I had to use the salsa to moisten it.  My husband's chimichanga was the same overly dry meat.  The guacomale is not homemade, but the type you can purchase in quantity at Sam's or Costco.

I'd love to find out the history of this location.  The feel is actually pretty southern when you walk in.

Patiently waited to take our order as we perused the menu options and checked in on us enough to be wonderful and not overwhelming.  \n\nI had the French Toast (2 slices) for just $3.50! He had the He Person breakfast, which was two enormous pancakes, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage patties and toast.  They were both delicious.  The french toast was made with Texas Toast and was sweet enough to satisfy a craving, but not overly so that it was too much after a few bites.  He had so much food he didn't make it but about half way through his pancakes and threw in the white towel.\n\nYes, it's an old building.  Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall that looks like it could use a new coat of paint, a better parking lot and a pressure washer.  BUT that would take all the unique aspects of this place away, and where is the fun in that??

Very easy on the taste buds.. \n\nThe service for the evening was great. Our server was great with his timing and very attentive to our needs... So you're probably wondering why I docked one star? Well.. I know this place is loud.. but certain people were noticebly loud even in such an environment.. There was a guy with a group of his friends, obviously coked out of his mind, screaming obscenities over his cell phone and smacking himself in the face, acting like a primate on speed... I ignored this the whole time, but my friend was obviously extremely bothered by it... We stayed cool about it, cuz we understand there's obviously people who can't handle even being in Vegas without obliterating every part of themselves that make them human... I just wish the staff may have noticed this and at least took the time to tell him to calm down..\n\nSo other than poor version of Kid Rock on crack, the rest of the experience was fine. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to get a nice, fun, dining experience without having to sacrifice their entire wallet.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

We were trying to go to Mesa Grill, but it was pucking facked. So you can tell, I was feeling something big and beefy which probably colored my menu selections a bit. Enough about me, more about Spago. Note they have 2 different menus depending on where you sit (cafe and dining room). We sat in the dining room. \n\nGroup of 3 of us arrived at about 7:30 on a Thursday, no wait at all (kind of atypical in Vegas!). We sat down, were served super promptly, and got  an amuse bouche of potato leek soup brought out right away. Awesome. They have a couple gin oddities on their bar, so I got a gin martini. Almost lost some points since the waiter asked if I wanted a lime in it (that would be a gimlet, not a martini). But whatevs. The martini was done very well...it had a remarkable floral scent to it quite a treat...try the cape rock organic gin. It was also $14, but that seems more the norm than the exception in Vegas.  \n\nI had the most elegantly presented heirloom tomato soup in the entire world.  The waiter brought a covered bowl to my table, lifted the top off, and there was a beautiful dense red soup with a pine branch drawn into the top of the soup using a olive oil/basil sauce. Stunning. And the soup was great too...the crouton served with it matched perfectly. Very very well done here.\n\nSince I was in a meaty/grilly mood (expecting to head to a Flay joint), I got the kobe flat iron steak. It was also exceptional. The steak was perfectly well done, nice and chewy (its a flatiron people, it should be chewy), but not tough at all. It was served with some broccolini which fit this dish perfectly. I'm only sorry I was too full for dessert.  \n\nThey brought out an assortment of bread in a basket before the appetizers, and I was having a tough time choosing between them since they all sounded great. After I made a tough choice for the bread I had selected, the waiter asked if I wanted something else. It was perfect - I was able to sample all of the breads that sounded great to me. He also came back 2-3 times during the meal to see if we wanted any more. Also, our water glasses never got below 1/3 full. Its weird, I've always wondered why the mid-high end restuarants typically don't have this kind of service, when you are clearly going to pay a fair chunck of change for dinner. Its awesome to see a place that really aims to please you in every way possible. Also, the wait staff was generally transparent during the meal even though they were doing a lot of work clearing our table, customizing cutlery, filling water, etc.\n\nThe dining area is perfectly decorated. Its a little trendy, but not blinking red light and technoey. The decor is so right because you can walk in there wearing anything (ahem...within reason) and not feel out of place. Its great for any age group - 20ish to 60ish. Its a little loud, but not disruptivley so. You are going to have to pay a bit for this place (app, dinner, and a single martini ran me $100 after tip), but I'd do it again on my own dime in a heartbeat.\n\nIts one of those rare 5 star places. Well done sir Puck.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QJlab4DqvBRJPUfg7Vn5ZQ"}

We had two experienced servers covering our table, being on top of things without being obtrusive.

We chose to split the octopus salad which was very flavorful!  Entrees of lamb for both of us were also excellent.  Dessert choices were peanut butter souffl\u00e9 and a chocolate dessert which I can't remember the name.  Interestingly, combining the two in each bite was delicious (think Reese peanut butter cups, yum).  Our server mentioned asking for chocolate chip mint ice cream with the peanut butter souffl\u00e9 is another good way to go.\n\nOnly observations of non 5 star accolades was the fairly loud background noise of the mall (seems out of place for such a nice restaurant).  And another concern, while the decor and artwork is nice, you find stacks of chairs on the second floor that seems tacky for such a place.  \n\nIf the adage is true, 'you get what you pay for' then Spago will not disappoint!", "type": "review", "business_id": "QJlab4DqvBRJPUfg7Vn5ZQ"}

Chef Selvaggio should be embarrassed to have his name on the front.\n2. I really hope the manager stops by to ask how we're doing.\n\nJim G. and I grabbed a few small bites in the bar area; I just wanted to try one pasta and didn't want to take up a whole table to do so.  Frankly, the servers might have been pleased. This place was \"dead anyway!\"  Perhaps our terrible service stemmed, in part, from the fact that we had \"bar servers;\" to me, that's still no excuse in a fine dining establishment.  Kristina, our server, was very polite, no question, but not at all good.  \n\nWe ordered oysters and a bottle of champagne.  The oysters arrive and when I ask the food runner what type they are, he has no idea; he runs off to ask and finally returns with the answer.  We are still waiting on our champagne. Oysters are getting warm and there's no champagne.  We see the manager, George, walk by with the champagne.  In the corner, both he and the bartender are trying to give Kristina a tutorial on opening champagne.  Our oysters are getting warm here people!  The bartender finally comes over to open it and we finally get to enjoy our lovely combination.\n\nWe also ordered a Scallop Crudo and the Garganelli Neri pasta.  Both come out way too early (oysters still on the table) and together.  There's no sense of pacing.  The crudo is good, with granny smith apple slices and an aged balsamic.  The pasta is not at all what I expected, but it is tasty.  The description (with a lobster carbonara, complete with sea urchin) made it sound creamy, unctuous, and decadent.  While there was a cream sauce (not very much of it) and there were lobster pieces, the dish lacked the feel and flavors the description suggested.  \n\nEmpty plates pile up, no one comes to pour the champagne, and while all this is (not) happening, the manager is standing there watching the Dallas-Miami game.  Kristina finally comes over to take (some) of the empty plates and proceeds to stack them on top of each other on our table, deciding to unstack a few (putting them back onto our table) because she's scared she'll drop them.  Has no one trained these servers how to work in a nice restaurant???\n\nI will never return to Valentino (Las Vegas, anyhow) and sincerely hope someone in management, but not George, reads this review and does something to remedy the glaring errors in service. This experience really gives Chef Selvaggio and his Michelin star a bad name.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MTSuKAjBcxQKSG0vX2sQLQ"}

This place serves very creative and eclectic style Mexican food. Most dishes aren't what people would traditionally imagine. One of my favorite dishes is the wild mushroom enchiladas. They are super tender and come covered with a light green colored sauce. Very mellow flavors. They have a vegetarian torta with a thick slice of grilled tofu, and typically I'll only eat tofu if it's in miso soup. One of my absolute favorites is the pezcado veracruz. It's the 'catch of the day' in a marisco (red) sauce with rice. Imagine a fish stew, with a large cut of fish in the middle. The Vaquero beef rib is also excellent. It's a well prepared short rib in mildly spicy mashed potatoes. This restaurant is the ONLY restaurant in The Venetian that is located directly on the canal. Whenever we went, we always were seated directly next to the canal. The wait staff is always super friendly. Although the hostesses have often been unfriendly and will take forever to acknowledge your presence. Their drinks are pretty good. I recommend the sangria by the bottle. It's fairly inexpensive and very good. Not a bad way to pass an hour or so, sitting with your sangria at the canal. I think a lot of people are expecting a different style of food here. It's more of a gourmet style, with interesting interpretations. Don't expect a big sloppy wet burrito. For the amount and quality of food, I consider this place to be cheap. Entrees are around the $20 mark and they charge for chips and salsa. But the portions are generous (not gigantic) and the food and atmosphere are second to none. You would be hard pressed to find a better location than this, in Vegas. I highly recommend for a late breakfast/early lunch, when they open around 11a. It's also nice to eat at a place when I don't have to get dressed  up, seriously I am on vacation, don't make me wear something nice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UBvTnbaRD3h_dD6oXWLCBA"}

They've been around for decades and there's even legends of Bill Clinton sending his secret service men to get Metro pizza when he stayed here. \n\nAnd I love Metro PIzza. I think their food is great. (read my Henderson review)\n\nBuuuut.... I've had rude service here..... so I'm going to get on my well-worn soapbox and pfffffft to all the Metro Pizza fanatics who have adamently told me that, \"METRO PIZZA IS THE BEST PIZZA. IN DA WORLD. FUUUUUUGH-ET-ABOUT-IT\". \n\nSorry to disappoint the Metro Pizza-for-lifers out there. But it is NOT the best pizza in the world, It is not even the best pizza in Las Vegas. The pizza crust is soggy in the middle, it has a tendency to sag. Sometimes, the dough is not fully cooked. A lot of that has to do with the way the make their pizza, in the traditional Neapolitan way, in a hot brick oven. It cooks the thin pizza quickly, so the more toppings, the soggier the top of the pizza becomes.\n\nBut in my humble opinion, Neopolitan pizza (although it's the original pizza) is NOT the best pizza in the world. (there. I said it. I hope they don't revoke my pizzalogist degree). I can make a darn good argument that the classic New York style pizza is better. \n\nThe pizza battles rage on. But I'm ceasing fire for now. Maybe another day....\n\nFYI: some Metro Pizza trivia, if you want an extra crispy crust, ask for extra crispy, not well-done. I won't give away any trade secrets, but there's a difference. If you ask for your pizza well-done, they will simply cook the pizza  longer.\n\n** my pictures are not linking to my review.

Being from Kansas City, one of America's 4 BBQ capitals sometimes you get a craving for BBQ and nothing else will do. But the last couple of times my fiancee and I have went to Memphis it's sucked. Let's just do this...here we go. \n\n1: You call to get on the wait list. Then when you get there...you still have to wait even when people who came in behind you get seated first. \n2: Slow service. Seriously...I had to get my own kids menu from the front counter. \n3: Enjoy the bread. One basket is all you'll get. \n4: Take your time figuring out what you want to eat. Your waiter will be so slow you can reread the menu 5 times, heck pull out your phone and Google the owner's name, Mike Mills. You've got PLENTY of time! \n5: More lukewarm food. Seriously, it's a BBQ place. I'm all for slow cooking, but dang, put some heat in it before you bring it to the table, and I'm talking physical temp, not heat measured in scoville units. \n6: Where's the Magic Dust? It tasted good on prior visits, but our table was missing a bottle of it this time around. \n7: Spicy sauce. There's nothing like having to ask for and then finally someone brings out a clogged up bottle of sauce to show just how much the staff gives a damn about the product they're bringing to the table. And the spicy sauce was an absolute ******* disgrace that anyone who claims to know anything about good BBQ would never, EVER send to the table. \n8: Yeah, my tea is empty, and my plate isn't finished. Why yes, I would like a refill...oh wait, you're too busy flirting with the blond at the table across from us to even notice our empty tea glasses. Sorry guy, she was too cute for you and your chances of getting her phone number are the same as me winning Megabucks, Powerball, and MegaMillions in the same week. Ain't ever gonna happen. \n9: Onion straws. This dish should be labeled as a \"tribute to Crisco\" dish. At least the table has a big roll of paper towels, perfect for spitting something back out. \n10: The brisket...was not bad, except for the fact it was cold. \n11: I think one of the types of meat was chicken. But if I was in front of a judge and had to say under oath what I thought it was I would have to say I honestly didn't know. \n\nThis visit was so bad I cringed at even leaving a 15% tip. I know the wait staff needs tips to make a living, but this was just bad. And I can't reward bad food and crappy service no matter how sympathetic I want to be. \n\n1 Star. And this time I gotta add Memphis to my Jackassery!

A simple, \"Sorry for the wait, I was backed up on other orders and couldn't get this out earlier for you\" would've sufficed. \n\nWhat's even BETTER is that when we mentioned pick-up-girl's attitude, the manager followed up with the same answer, \"next time call ahead if you'll be arriving early\" without so much as a hint of apology. Clearly WE were in the wrong here. It was definitely a missed opportunity on the manager's part to turn the situation around and save our experience from being so disappointing. Coming from a background in retail and fast food, I was baffled by their self-righteous, unapologetic attitudes.\n\nI also didn't understand why 1. the manager was working in the fulfillment line the whole time and 2. there were periods of time when there were no customers to help - whey didn't someone (like, ahem, the manager) go and help the girl filling pickup orders?\n\nI've never had a bad experience at Chipotle before today, and will definitely never come back to this location.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BfTGq2PskVpTaDRtG5baeQ"}

Called in my order for takeout and headed on over. Upon entering, saw that the restaurant itself was a bit nicer and more upscale than I expected. Service was a bit lackluster- waited for a bit at the door before being acknowledged, my boxed food was waiting at a table with a manager-looking guy who brought over my receipt and took my card with a series of gestures, then ran my card and disappeared without a thank you or asking if I needed anything else. \nThat probably explains why I didn't get any utensils or napkins, nor did I add on another side or additional naan as I'd originally planned. And there were only two tables seated at 5:30PM so it's not because they were busy.\n\nI found this place to be a bit pricey. \nI like that half-size entrees are available for a slightly-lesser fee, but found that the decrease in pricing (usually around $3) isn't worth the decrease in product. Lesson learned. For three half-size entrees, one container of rice was provided. Also ordered one garlic naan. Total was around $40, which is a bit steep. I always have difficulty paying so high for a la carte indian food when the buffet prices are so cheap for so much. I feel like there's a discrepancy there that should result in lower prices rather than higher, but whatever.\n\nQuality made my entree choices worthwhile: saag paneer, baingan bharta, and lamb korma. The saag was decent but I prefer mine a little saucier, this one was a lot of spinach and good-sized cubes of paneer but the dish seemed as if it hadnt been cooked down long enough. Best eaten with the garlic naan, which was fragrant and delicious.\nBaingan bharta was ordered exclusively based on recommendations here on Yelp, and I was not disappointed. It was flavorful and I appreciated that the sauce was on the thicker side, which allowed for it to go well with the rice. \nThe lamb korma is the only dish that had any spice to it whatsoever, and it was quite mild despite ordering a 5/10- at Thai restaurants, that'll get you a spicy dish, but I guess Indian is a little more laid back with the scale. I know now for next time. Dish didn't have quite as much lamb as expected for a $10 portion.\n\nSpeaking of portions, I was a little confused by the portions and packing of my takeout.\nI appreciated that the half-size entree portions were packed in plastic lidded containers and wrapped in plastic to ensure that nothing spilled. But the size of the portions themselves were on the small side- think the smallest hummus containers at the grocery. That size. \n\nGoing to put this on the list to try again for the lunch buffet, thinking that will be a better value and possibly a better overall experience. Good quality, vast menu of options including several vegetarian dishes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gkWEjZIVcrUerEzed6IKpg"}

Swiss Cafe has been a Vegas institution since 1972. I remember eating duck with juniper berries here for Thanksgiving when I was in elementary school. They have yet to update a single furnishing or decoration in the intervening decade since. The alfresco dining area has seen better days- the marble tabletops are stained and chipped, the white fencing is rusted, and the \"garden\" greenery has been laid to rest for sometime. In defiance of its stale, VERY Swiss interior, the food here is good. I don't like Swiss or German or Austrian food - in fact, the entire time I was in Germany and Austria I avoided eating anything traditional (save for pig knuckle and beer). However, the schnitzel here is something I will eat for the sake of tradition and not completely hate it- it's lightly breaded, almost like a tempura rather than a big thick coating of greasy breading like you find at Vegas' Hofbrauhaus (which, by the way, is an insult to the original). Entrees come with fried spaetzle, which I found too crunchy, and sweet purple cabbage is served in place of sauerkraut, which was very good. The escargot was decent enough, although they serve them in \"their\" shell making eating one of these suckers an exercise in dexterity. The soups are okay- the shrimp bisque was creamy and subtle, the French onion was unspectacular. Not too many fun German wine options - the only Riesling on the menu was $60. Service is very good because this place is always so dead (only two other tickets over the course of our three hour dinner). Overall, Swiss is a casual, relatively inexpensive continental restaurant that is worth going to for the excellent Schnitzel and the vintage vibe.", "type": "review", "business_id": "K-_erZm_YNzg0Ahzcdx0TQ"}

It's a waffle shaped like a taco with scrambled eggs and your choice of sausage or bacon. I chose bacon.\n\nI should of chose hunger. If you refer to my pic, it actually looks decent but looks can be deceiving. Dont expect the waffle to be crispy like they just actually toasted it or made fresh from scratch. It is obviously microwaved because it is already soggy when you get it. They give you a tiny container of syrup. You know, the kind of container you would dip nuggets in if you were at McDonalds. I guess you are supposed to either dip your \"Taco\" in it or just pour it on top. Mind you I actually parked in theTB parking lot so I dont make a mess. You definitely dont wanna be driving while eating this thing. So I pour the syrup into my taco. It had the consistency of watered down cough syrup. The taste? Ha, Robitussin tasted way better and I hate that stuff! This syrup tasted like actual tree sap. As for the bacon bits, you know how you can get imitation bacon bits at the supermarket? Well, they imitated an imitation. So what it tastes like is comparable to those knock off perfume and cologne bottles that random people sell in random parking lots. The ones that kind of smell like the real thing but only lasts like 2 minutes. The bacon bits on these things were basically red construction paper dipped in bacon grease and shredded.\n\nI only ate half of it and was surprised I even ate that much. I guess I didnt want to face the fact that I lost good hard earned money for it? I kid you not, I coudnt wait til lunch came around so I can dump a lot of hot sauce in whatever I will eat in order to kill any remnants of that garbage I just ate. Makes me wonder if they test these things on animals. Good God, I just realized that we are the animals! \n\nThis is not the first time I fell for their marketing gimmicks. Lets see, there was the Cantina Bowl, XL Steak Nachos, and the XXXL Steak Flatbread thing. All these were total fails. I guess the only person I can blame is myself because I keep thinking that maybe they will make a mistake somewhere along the line and use actual ingredients. Then they will be scratching their heads why all of a sudden people are lining up by the truckloads.\n\nSo in closing, I gave two stars because the only thing that I will ever have hope for is the Mexican Pizza. That has never let me down before and even if it does, the percentage of it making me sick is very low. Maybe because my stomach has grown tolerant of it? Gahh, that sounds scary. Notice I never mentioned the service. Fyi, I have yet to find one worthy of mentioning and this location is no different. Memo to TB corporate, stop smoking that weed and try real ingredients. At least put some of that weed in your product so we think its good when we are just actually hallucinating. Plus you get the munchies when you are high which in turn will help sell you more tacos. And no, I dont do weed. Well not voluntarily anyway. Sometimes you smell secondhand weed smoke and you get the munchies as well.

I've yet to find AMAZING mexican food in Las Vegas which is pretty damn disappointing.  Casa Don Juan is near my downtown office so I've been several times.  Here's a little rundown as I've tried several things on the menu-\n\nChips and Salsa- the colorful dressed waitstaff bring out chips and salsa with black beans which is pretty awesome. Bonus points for the black beans fo sho!   Add a margarita on the rocks (with salt of course, hey, I said I was mexican. lol) and BAM!  You have one of my favorite snacks/appetizers.\n\nGuacamole- I'm suuuper picky with my guacamole and pride myself on making the best.  Meh.  Enough said.\n\nCaldo- for you gringos, that means soup.  Probably my favorite thing at Casa.  Served with homemade tortillas. Its pretty amazeballs!!!  Damn I wish I had some for breakfast right now. Big bowl with veggies, beef, and spice filled broth that is out of this world!  Most people sprinkle the top with fresh onions, cilantro, and lime. I hold the onions, but wow, definitely a tasty filling meal!\n\nTacos- unlike that disgusting place down the road Macayos, Casa's taco shells are homemade.  Filled with shredded chicken (or beef), lettuce and tomato...BOMB.\n\nEnchiladas- pretty gross.  the sauce is runny and just doesn't have a good taste.  Actually their enchiladas get a big fat \"D-.\"  The only thing worse than Casa's enchiladas are when people make enchiladas with FLOUR tortillas instead of corn.  WHAAAAT??  Fail.\n\nChile Relleno- ugh, I hate when a place messes up a chile relleno. Its pretty filling, cheese is just right, but the awful sauce they suffocate that poor chile with is pure caca. See my above review on enchiladas.\n\nRice and beans- pretty impressive!  I'm probably the most picky when it comes to these two sides and I have to say, they're almost perfect.\n\nMargaritas- awesome!  They get an extra star for their tasty drinks.  The only time I crave a margarita is with my chips and salsa, but these are done RIGHT. I also request a better tequila because tequila makes me SUPER feisty! I Know my limits. lol.\n\nService- always very fast and not to toot my own horn but the owner likes a pretty lady so yeah, I always get seated very fast.  Just saying because its so obvious! lol.  \n\nPrices- they've upped their prices over the last few years, so their specials are the way to go if you're trying to keep the cost down.  For good mexican I'll pay more, just not sure if this place is completely worth it.  \n\nOverall Casa Don Juan is decent.  I'm always up for suggestions on great mexican food.  I want AUTHENTIC.

I didn't know it was that far until I called another coworker for directions, and realized it was \"Holy Cow! I am practically starting to drive back to California\" far.  Last time I came here to eat, I just blindly followed Maryland Parkway all the way down until I reached the destination.\n\nWe arrived at 11:45am, when they opened and they already have 1/3 of the restaurant filled on a Wednesday.  Coworkers have raved about this place for a good 9 months we been working together and the food they served I have enjoyed.  And this time it was pretty good, except for the first order of sushi roll we were served (the rice tasted like it was old from last night).  But after that the rice seemed fresh like the fresh super white tuna they served us.\n\nTip:  Always check the specials of the day or ask the sushi chefs.\n\nToday's Special:\nSuper White Tuna - so good we ordered a second round, and highly recommended. \nCajun Salmon - it was alright\nJapanese Snapper- alright\nFresh Scallop - pretty good (I don't care for the yum yum scallops the Japanese sushi places serve here in general)\nYellowtail Belly - don't have it :(\nWe also ordered the limit 1 per customer items:\nUni - good\nAmaebi - good (but no deep fried heads)\nHamachi Kama(Yellowtail collar) - good. Makes an excellent meal with just rice.\n\nTried the poki roll (didn't look like what we ordered last time) and the rice was not fresh. It tasted like it was from the previous night.\n\nSpider Roll - huge and tasted great, but served with rice paper.  Rice paper usually costs $1 more, but I still like it made with the traditional nori.\nPixie Roll - Another huge roll, and tasted good.\nVolcano Roll - Pretty good, but can be messy to eat.  But sometimes messy is a good thing when it comes to food :)\n\nAlso order:\nMasago with Quail Eggs - it was beautiful and I enjoyed it\nTamago - The eggs are most likely ordered premade, and they just to cut it and assemble it with the rice and nori strip, but I liked it nonetheless.\nFresh Water Eel - not bad\n\nDesserts - we each picked different ones. I had the green tea ice cream, coworkers ordered the Lychee Sorbet (looks good), and Tempura Ice Cream (good).\n\nBUT after we asked for and signed for our credit cards and the waitress came and picked stuff off of our table, I suddenly see a confused cockroach stumbling from where the soy sauce bottles and AYCE menu is.  I was in shocked and not sure where it came from, except maybe when the waitress came she might have set something down on the table, and grabbed our dessert bowls and left the unwanted hitchhiker.

This also allowed us to pool our various orders and get the most variety while we also got the most bang for our buck. Sitting at the bar is advisable if you want to get straight to business. Obviously, lunch will deliver a better value.\n\nThe miso was a boon to us dehydrated souls. The Nigiri is all very solid. Their garlic tuna is a delicious standout, and you can't go wrong with the yellow tail. The mackerel offers that ever so distinctive fresh water taste-- may not be for everyone.\n\nYou could just as easily fill up exclusively on their specialty rolls and definitely not go wrong there. The Hurricane impressed me most of all-- so many flavors dancing on the tongue that I couldn't even describe them to you. Ecstasy roll = solid. The Flying Jason, while delicious, should be ordered with caution. It's one of the cooked rolls and contains melted cheese with a distinct, mustard like aftertaste. Great stuff but it is very filling and should probably be ordered right before dessert if at all (if you care about maximizing your value). The same goes for the Baked 428-- yummy but oh so filling. \n\nThe tempura ice cream-- I don't know how many sushi places do this but this place definitely does it RIGHT. Perhaps the most guilt ridden dessert per gram-- it is a serving of mochi covered in a doughnut like tempura crust that creates an absolutely heavenly experience (and one that can be enjoyed with chop sticks, nonetheless!) You must order this, at least once in your life.\n\nIf you are in the mood for gorging on quality sushi and don't want to shell out the cash for a place on the strip, I can promise you that Sushi Mon will lull you into a peaceful food coma.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yD1dRYi7USzhYVKiqZ7JVg"}

He found this place online and wanted to try it due to some awards they received from Best of Vegas.  I then looked it up on here and read about the special offer for a free pot of bread.  I love bread and was excited to find out what it was exactly and to try it.  After our waitress took our orders I mentioned Yelp and asked about the pot of bread.  She didn't seem familiar with the offer, but didn't question it at all and brought me one.  In case you're wondering, it's a personal sized piece of bread that comes in a little round bowl and resembles a large cupcake.  I got the cinnamon-raisin one and it was definitely the best part of my dining experience.  The top was just a little toasted and the middle was soft and chewy.  If that were all I ate I'd have given them 5 stars, but sadly it went downhill from there.    \nI ordered an omelet with avocado, bacon, and cheddar and it was a big disappointment.  There was quite a bit of bacon inside, but it was all way overcooked and a little thick, so it was rock hard.  The avocado was good but it was all on one side, so I had to open it up and spread it out.  Also, the only cheddar I found was a few shredded pieces on top.  Like I said, very disappointing.  In hindsight I should have sent it back and either gotten something else or had them remake it.\nThey give a choice of hash browns or home fries and I had the latter.  They were good and had bits of onion and bell pepper mixed in.  Overall, I can see how this place could be good, but my experience wasn't the best.

Price is at about $25.95 per person (take note, auto 18% gratuity for i believe 4 or 5+ people parties). There is also no child price. Friendly staff and chefs. \n\nRestaurant is located in a decent area on the west side of Las Vegas\n\nThere is the option to order a la carte as well for sushi as well as their teppenyaki menu. \n\nTo get the full experience, try to get a seat at the sushi bar and watch the sushi chefs make your's and everyone elses order in front of you. Sometimes if you are lucky, the owner (short japanese man) will be working the bar. Quite the entertainment. \n\nThis is the only (that i know of) AYCE sushi restaurant that serves sashimi as well [with no limits on amaebi (sweet shrimp) or uni (sea urchin)]. The have a wide variety of appetizers ranging from shrimp shu mai, seaweed salad, and miso soup to hamachi kama (grilled yellow tail neck). The hamachi kama is usually one of the things i always order here, usually fresh off the grill, nice and hot. \n\nThey also have a wide variety of nigiri and rolls. For rolls, not as much as what some may have seen at other AYCE places like Sushi Mon or Yama Sushi but its a sufficient amount with choices ranging from like rainbow roll, spider roll, etc. Fish is usually fresh and fatty. On the health and safety issue, the fish is usually covered (some places around town do not even do this...)\n\nI usually order a combination of salmon, yellowtail, and tuna sashimi. For nigiri, the size/amount of rice used, is about average for most restaurants, not too much, not too less. Does not fall apart either. \n\nYou can say this restaurant is more for \"fish-lovers\" over the non-traditional \"roll-lovers\" as it is based more on the fish than rolls. Though that is usually not a bad thing for smaller eaters like my mom. She loves to come to Hikari due to having the option of ordering sashimi vs nigiri that comes with rice which usually (should fill you up faster due to expanding rice in stomach). \n\nThis restaurant is one of my family's favorite sushi restaurants (not only of those who live in Las Vegas, but as well as my cousins from Reno in northern Nevada, and Bay Area in northern Calfornia. \n\nHighly recommended restaurant to try if you are in the area. I wouldn't say this restaurant is not good for kids, but for the price and amount they can eat, i don't think its worth it too much? But i guess if the parent doesn't mind, it's fine.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonal rating - about 7 out of 10", "type": "review", "business_id": "bB1bVvOMkfvWFVbNmRl_VA"}

While there's not a ton on it, it's awesome to be able to get a good bottle of wine for a tenner. \n - There are several appetizers that I would recommend; I've never had a bad experience with any of them. Personal favorite would be the hummus platter, but the wings are good, as are pierogies. And for the Lord's sake, get yourself some waffle fries with whatever you're eating.\n - The burgers are among the best in town (IMHO). There are others I prefer, but these guys know how nail the difference between rare and medium rare, and the flavors are terrific. Also, if you're carb-conscious, you can get what they call a \"Steakburger dinner,\" where you get the burger and fixings without a bun, plus a salad and vegetables. Pretty durn good.\n - The salads are also delicious, though monstrously large. If you're eating salad to cut back on calories, probably don't bother here. But if you eat salad LIKE A BOSS, then go for this.\n\nThe minuses:\n\n - It gets awfully crowded and can be difficult to get a seat at times. (Though, service never seems to suffer from this.)\n - It's on Craig Street, which means you might have to knife-fight some Carnegie Mellon students for a parking spot.\n - Not a huge fan of the decor.

I thought it might cause problems but I went with the flow.  That was a big mistake.

I kind of expected more from the hype (and from the fact that I paid $2.50 for it). \n\nTo be fair to Lux, I've been back since and the espresso and americanos were much better on my subsequent visits. In any event, it's always nice to take a break from the frenzied pace of life and to avoid the Starbucks drive-thrus as much as possible.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aRkYtXfmEKYG-eTDf_qUsw"}

This is just an observation and has not a lot to do with the overall rating. \n\n#2 - It was crazy crowded in the middle of a weekday. The place itself isn't that big, so I assume there's a big following (confirmed by the number of reviews for this place). This made it difficult to lay my things out and have adequate study space. \n\n#3 - Smaller space + people = really narrow walk ways when people are standing in line to order.\n\n#4 - Coffee is good, but not as strong as I personally like. \n\nWith that said, the perks here are ambiance (fun art on the walls that I imagine are changed everyone once in awhile), good people watching, parking despite the amount of people here, and the fact that its by the light rail. \n\nSo yep, Lux is a solid coffee spot, but I think I'll keep looking for the coffee shop of my dreams.. with table space and stronger coffee.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aRkYtXfmEKYG-eTDf_qUsw"}

While I had heard of the Los Dos before I have never taken the time to get here until one fateful November night.\n\nWe arrived and parked up close to the door which I thought was to indicate we would have no wait, how I was mistaken! There was no obvious signs from the outside that the seating inside was so small. We put in our name and waited on the outside patio where we had some chips and salsa to wait for our names. 45 minutes later, a bowl of chips and two frosty AZ dwellers were seated inside near the kitchen entrance. Hooray!\n\nNoted was the d\u00e9cor of crazy New Mexico style. An employee took our drink and appetizer order quickly and our chips/salsa and guacamole came out quickly. Besides finding pieces of the core in our guac we were beginning to be satisfied. Another different employee came to take our food order which we were ready to provide. Things were looking up until the lights went off...\n\nApparently the tradition here at Los Dos is to turn the lights out for a birthday customer and bring them out a flaming Hispanic dish. The problem with this was that the lights were out for about 8 minutes before anyone produced said item. So there we sat, in the dark with no clue as to what was going on. Bells clanging, people clapping and fire spouting came the traditional celebratory food. Good we thought, we can carry on now.\n\nThen things got ugly. Well, we got our dinners first, and then we notice a slight commotion in the corner table. What I originally thought was an older disabled man who needed help getting up after his dinner was actually a heavily intoxicated older man who had *ahem* thrown up his two margaritas and his dinner onto himself and the floor. From what my companion tells me the margaritas are particularly strong here at Los Dos and so we were present to witness this older man basically incapacitated from two Margs. Paramedics are called. Hoopla commences.\n\nWe decided to bite the bullet and finish our meal and try to make the best of things. The food it turns out is very good. Tamales, tacos and chimichangas were ordered and enjoyed. Very flavorful and well made, definitely enjoyed the green sauce here. Not too hot and not too weak, just right.\n\nUnfortunately this brings the final flaw in our night of dining. After our dinners were brought out to us, we sat, and sat and sat some more with no employees even looking at us for nearly 35 minutes. No queries for drinks, more chips, dessert, nada. I finally went up to the register and the lady handed me my check. I asked if this was the normal practice because I had never been to the restaurant before and had sat waiting for additional help/check/anything. She nodded and apologized to then blame the craziness that had gone on. While I understood, there had been only two employees helping the elderly gentleman who tossed up his dinner and neither were the ones that had helped us thus far. \n\nNevertheless I paid our tab and we made our way out. Full and satisfied from food but disappointed in the experience overall. Whether Los Dos will get another shot is still undecided, perhaps another location at the least.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nQUsMhT7qY6pPMvTT6xGcQ"}

Two of my party even declared pre-soup that they hate coconut-based concoctions, but after trying one spoonful they were ladling it out right fast. We found level 7 to be satisfyingly spicy without being bland. For an entree I ordered the pork panang curry, level 7. Delicious. Not the best in the world, and the pork was a little bland, but it was oddly comforting food. I would have preferred it a little spicier, but I suspect they think white ladies are lying when they ask for hot and spicy food. Girl I am not lying: I like my spicy!

What an incredible appetizer... even the name is appetizing. My entree was the Ancho Crusted Sea Scallop, and oh my I am glad I got that. The meal had such a rich flavor and was wonderfully complimented by the Cornmeal Crusted Anaheim Chile Relleno and, believe it or not, the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Walnuts and Pomegranates.  Insanity!\n\nI also really enjoyed the emphasis Mesa puts on their Tequila selection. They have over 30 brands of Tequila in Blanco and Anejo styles to fit your taste, and since Tequila fits my taste it was quite a nice way to try new styles.  \n\nAt least go for tequila and an app or two. At most go all out because this place has great food, wonderful service, and a light tasteful atmosphere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

The bartender was great and our waitress Tiffany was awesome and attentive. Some of the best service I have ever experienced. This is including the bus boy.\n\nWe started with the Prawn Tamale appetizer which was cooked to perfection. The masa corn mix was perfectly flavored.\n\nI ordered the 15 spice chicken with mango salsa. This was tender and a large portion. My sides were mashed potatoes and the blue cheese corn side which was so so so delicious.\n\nI had a view of the kitchen, it was hard for me to tell how the dishes are transfered from the kitchen to the wait staff, it looked confusing to me. Last time we were here something happened and while I was served my pork loin dish after 20 minutes and my hubby was served his steak dish which turned cold. Its almost as if another waiter took my dish for another table at the time and his dish sat awhile. \n\nThey handled the situation well at the time.

Yes, the floors are sticky and the bathrooms are nightmarish. Yes, the people are surly. But who cares! You really won't find better fries anywhere. When you walk in, walk immediately past the hot dog counter (they're okay but not important) back to the fry counter. If you are with 3 or fewer people, get a small--it'll be more than enough. I'd come in with a group of seven and get a medium (\"serves 3-4\") and it was always MORE than enough. Purists will claim you don't need anything but salt on the fries, but I always liked that ersatz cheese sauce. It lent just a touch of class to the whole experience. It's basically the same thing as a Mornay, yo!\n\nAnd the fries? Hot, crispy, fluffy on the inside, glistening with oil that burns your tongue when you put it in your mouth. The oil probably hasn't been changed since 1974, but that's part of the charm. Anyone who's anyone knows these fries are where it's at. Forget Five Guys, screw Point Brugge--this is the true Pittsburgh potato-based food experience.\n\nDO NOT GET THE PIZZA WHATEVER YOU DO. I DON'T CARE HOW DRUNK YOU ARE.

The service at this location, however, was awful. When we walked in the manager attempted to seat us even though there was a perfectly capable hostess standing right there. He took us into the dining area, asked us to wait in an awkward location and then disappeared. He never wrote our name or party number down at the hostess station or even bothered to tell her that we would need seated. We waited there for about 20 minutes, and a few other parties who seemed to have just walked in were seated ahead of us. At one point the manager even walked up to us again and asked if we needed a table. I honestly believe that in his mind this was the first time he had ever interacted with us.\n\nAfter grabbing the hostess and explaining the situation, we were seated pretty quickly. Sadly that was not the end of our troubles. Our waiter was very obnoxious and more interested in hearing himself talk than actually listening to anyone. I got the impression that he was trying to imitate a tough-guy New York deli owner you might see on TV. A number of people asked for their coleslaw on the side because, frankly, it's gross. Each time he challenged the person, claiming that they must not have eaten here before and that we didn't know what we were doing and that \"that's just how we do it here in Pittsburgh\" (Just for the record we were all born and raised in Pittsburgh and have eaten at Primanti Brothers countless times). I think he thought he was being charming like those beloved caricatures he was clearly imitating from TV, but it was really just annoying.\n\nI like Primantis a lot, and it was nice to visit the original location, but I think that status of \"first\" may have gone to their head. I would definitely recumbent that you visit a different location. Additionally, the other locations I've visited have wider beer and mixed drinks selection and more items on the menu, so that's a plus.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Q4ULAiIE2qCA4RYplCTrUQ"}

Gross!\n\nLiver Mousse and Pate - I guess no one orders these items here - I could tell because all the edges were all dried out - pretty disgusting. \n\nEndive salad - It is not a great experience to have green leaves turn brown and wilt. \n\nMussels - bad,,,,, They didn't break my expectation. NOT FRESH! At this point, I was concerned about food poisoning. So, I asked to get a check.

I guess those people who are giving 5 stars just eat burgers and steaks, not seafood. \n\nService - not that great - too busy all the time - my server wasn't nice at all - she didn't stop at our table. No refills. I saw she was chatting for a while at another table, tho. \n\nYou will see all the men in black here - they indeed look professional in a funny way - but imagine if they change it to Denny's uniforms - surly enough, they would fit really well.\n\nAlso, when I made a reservation today (Sat.

It's dark inside. Not romantic dark, but oddly too dark. \n\nAfter reading a lot of reviews and seeking suggestions from the Yelp community, it was strongly suggested that we go for the tasting menu. We chose the Domestic Wagyu beef tasting at $140/person. A bit expensive of course, but we wanted to splurge so we did it despite our better judgement. \n\nFirst of all, if this is the route you plan to take, please make sure you arrive with an empty stomach. The portion sizes would make Mr. Buca Di Beppo blush. \n\nAs part of the tasting, you are allowed (I say allowed b/c the chef is rather particular about what and how you order) to order appetizers, salads, two steak options, of which you cannot order the same cut and a dessert accompaniment. Yes, that much food!!\n\nCow:\n\nThe steaks were prepared medium and arrived a little closer to medium rare. I am fine with it, but my lady doesn't like it too rare. I mean, could we send it back? Of course. But it would be nice if they just follow what's ordered. \n\nSides: \n\nPotato Gratin was ok. I hate this dish simply b/c made at home or at a high end restaurant, it doesn't matter. Once you cut into it you either need to eat every bite within moments or deal with the fact that it solidifies quickly and no longer tastes the way it should. Mushrooms were a huge hit, for me at least. Roasted, seasoned well and delicious!! Baby carrots were, well baby carrots. \n\nDessert:\n\nSelections were incredible! Choco indulgence was my second fave. Chocolate mousse covered with chocolate ganache and served with house made chocolate ice cream. However, this took a back seat to their Monkeybread.

I came here on Sunday for Brunch since I had heard that that was the meal to come for.  My friends and I were seated promptly at around 12:30.  Our waiter seemed inexperienced, awkward, and hasty throughout the meal.  My first complaint was that we didn't even get water or bread until practically 30 minutes into the meal because our waiter forgot we hadn't received it yet.  We received the spreads pretty quickly, but had no bread to eat it with.\n\nI was really excited to see that they had chicken and waffles on the menu.  My friends and I decided to all get the same thing except...they were out of chicken and waffles.  MAJOR disappointment.  First of all, how do you run out of chicken and waffles when it's not even that late into brunch? That wasn't even the biggest thing that made me frustrated.  After not knowing what to order, we just decide to ask for the special which was Chicken Rilletes.  The waiter proceeded to tell us that they were out of the special as well.  HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF CHICKEN AT A PLACE LIKE THIS?? and why would you keep it written all over every sign on your walls?? wouldn't it make sense just to erase it off the board if you're out?  I should have left by now, but I felt too bad to just leave the restaurant especially since we had already been sitting there for about 20 minutes and attempted to order food twice.  For our third time ordering, we just settled on steak frites, hamsteak, and the croque madame.  The steak frites was mediocre at best, with the fries being the dish's saving grace.  I had requested that the steak be medium rare and the steak came so rare that I could barely cut into it without the entire table rocking back and forth.  I asked them if they could reheat it a little more to a medium and the waiter hesitated to even fulfill my request.  I didn't understand why it would be difficult to do that, but in the end, he was able to do it.  Too bad it took so long that my friends had already finished their dishes before my steak even came back so I ended up having to pack it to go.  \n\nSad to say, the bread and fries were probably the best part of the meal.  I expected better from a place with such high ratings and comments, but I guess it's possible I just came on a bad day.

At least change the menu to say \"$7.50 for three and $2.50 each additional!\") \n\nAnyway the fish tacos were lovely, very fresh, full of cilantro and plump white fish.

Because, yeah, its pretty friggin hot! You have to know that I put the whole cup of sauce onto one taco, in a dimly lit area of the patio around 9 at night.

Not one of those where you're rationed. Lobsters are full size, not the langostino variety. \n+ High quality food - large shrimp cocktail, jumbo king crab legs, fresh raw oyster, ripe fresh fruit \n+ Service - high touch attentive service - beverages refilled immediately. Napkins refolded every time I left the table and replaced when dirty. \n\nNegatives \n- Broiled lobster was over done and thus tough \n- Kind crab leg wasn't halved so you have to crack the legs. Not easy given the pointy spines and buttery sauce coating the legs . Had 1 leg and gave up. Maybe that was the objective. \n- $85 + tax and tip. Not for the faint of heart \n- Dessert selection was OK \n- Ambiance - stuffy dark old school steak house ambiance. Would have preferred for light, airy venue given this is Sunday brunch \n- Only offered on Sundays. Not the best day given we've already gorged ourselves the whole weekend and who wants to get stuffed right before they jump on a plane or car.

After eating lunch at the disappointment that was Pho at TI, I was definitely ready for some real food. The Bellagio buffet has been known to be one of the best buffets in Vegas. I don't think I've been here for dinner so I was pretty excited. My first surprise was actually the price. $45 for dinner is pretty hefty, even for a buffet, but I just thought of that as a challenge to eat my worth of king crab legs and meat for the price of entrance. \n\nAfter we were seated, I went straight for the king crab legs, which always seems to be in season here. They were good as always and I probably polished off a dozen or so. Moving on, I skipped all the other food sections and went straight for the carving station. Tonight, they had rack of lamb, ostrich, and roasted duck breast. The rack of lamb lollipops were definitely the highlight of the meal. They were cooked perfectly and the taste was fancy restaurant quality. I think I finished half a dozen of those before trying some ostrich and the duck breast. The duck breast was also very flavorful, but the meat was actually a little bit on the tough side. \n\nThere were also a ton of other dishes that were quite impressive. I had an affinity for the mushroom ravioli with truffle essence, which was a winner over the lobster ravioli. The cocktail shrimp and smoked salmon were also my winners. I think the other only thing I remember that was good was the tiny ramekin with mac and cheese. \n\nThe one thing that I was disappointed by was dessert. The offerings were just not that impressive and they didn't even have real ice cream. Soft serve isn't acceptable at a buffet as nice as Bellagio's. I will say that I did enjoy the sour cream cheesecake, which was probably my favorite out of the group.

Our dinner was good and we were served very well. \n\nWe were led down to our table by a young guy in a suit. There were many guys in suits. It shocked the crap out of us when one of them started talking into his sleeve like secret service. That was weird. Another guy in a suit wheeled a glass topped case in front of our table and began telling us about the restaurant and the fish specialties. This was one of the weirdest, most awkward dudes I have ever had approach any table in any restaurant. He rambled on and on and on and. . . Finally he left us and the sommelier came around to take our wine order. Then our server came by to find out what we wanted to eat. Through the whole dinner we had the sommelier, two guys in suits (I still don't know what those guys do.), three servers and two bus boys.  It was Valentines Day and we would have liked some more time to spend together.\n\nFor food (Yes, I'm gonna' get around to talking about food.) we started with the duck liver mousse and the octopus salad. Both of which were outstanding. The duck liver mousse was unbelievable. It was served with brioche. My girlfriend said that she wanted it for her entree. Perfect texture. The bread brought to the table was very good. It's baked fresh on site in the hotel. \n\nFor dinner my girlfriend ordered the fruite di mare with pasta. It was very nice. I ordered the lamb chops. They were served with jus, potatoes, carrots and peas. Really? For $56? Two of the four chops were well cooked past my medium rare order. When I get into the last chop I realize they gave me the end cut. Why would you give me the end cut if I ordered medium rare? For $56. \n\nWe sampled a few desserts. One of them was a lemon tart with tuille cookie over the top. It was served with a rosemary ice cream and balsamic reduction. As we ate through the tart we realized there was lemon curd in the center that flowed out when we cut into it. Very nice. We were served samples of three gelatos, three sorbets and three granites. All of which were very good. \n\nAgain, the dinner was very good besides it being somewhat pedestrian, the restaurant was beautiful and we were treated very well.

We made reservations for a party of 6 during the last evening of Restaurant week.  Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and shown to our own private dining room with a single table for 6.  Immediately, they asked us if the music volume was ok and promptly lowered the volume to accommodate our enthusiastic conversations.  The inner decor was marine life focused with a tranquil and peaceful spa-like vibe, which greatly entertained our party, as one of the ladies is an avid diver.  \n\nThe first course consisted of a choice of the following delights: \n1) Lobster Bisque with Maine Lobster, Caviar, Creme Fraiche \n2) Crab Cakes with Marinated Vegetable Relish, Citrus Aioli, Petite Mache \n3) Halloumi & Watermelon with Shishito Peppers, Basalmic Vinegar \n4) Romaine Hearts & Treviso Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese Caesar\n\nI opted for the crab cakes, which were excellent!  The citrus aioli totally made the dish.  I tasted the lobster bisque, which was also delish with delicate, but oh so rich creme fraiche.  The real winner of course #1 took me by surprise; the halloumi & watermelon salad.  Boyfriend ordered it because he is allergia a los mariscos (I know you all remember that phrase from Spanish 101 practice work!)  Back to the story, being the goat cheese-aholic that I am, I would have ordered this dish if I understood what halloumi was.  I will never make that mistake again!  Hailing from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus,  halloumi is a semi-hard, unripened brined cheese made from a mixture of goat and sheep milk, and sometimes also cow milk.  It has a high melting point, and often fried or grilled, with a strong savory bite, with a slightly creamy texture.  Mmmm mmmm gewd!\n\nBefore course #2 arrived, the manager spoiled our party with a 3 special treats, which he explained were some of his absolute favorite things on the menu.  \n1) Smoked king salmon with pickled vegetables and buttery crunchy toasts  \n2) NY littleneck clams with garlic & chili in white wine herb butter \n3) Hollander mussels in chardonnay herb butter broth.  \nHonestly, this free little treat might have been the absolute best dishes to grace our table.  We were all politely sharing, but fighting our animal instinct to greedily ravage these dishes and lick the bottom of the bowls clean!\n\nThe second course consisted of a choice of the following indulgences:\n1) Pacific White Prawns with Pearl Couscous, Lobster Cream, Cherry Tomatoes, Scampi Garlic Butter \n2) Prime Ribcap Steak Frites with Roasted Shallot Red Wine Glaze \n3) Mt. Cook Alpine King Salmon with Vegetable Ragout, Buerre Blanc \n4) Roasted Jidori Chicken - Celeriac Puree, Glazed Baby Carrots, Sauce Ver Jus\nThe whole party's orders were split between the prawns and the steak.  My only complaint is that I was torn between the salmon and prawns.  Having a less than stellar salmon experience the previous night led me to try the prawns.  All of the steaks were cooked to perfection.\n\nThe third course consisted of a choice of these treats:\nVanilla Bean Creme Brulee or Homemade Ice Cream Sundae\nI think the entire table ordered and enjoyed the creme brulee, which was as delicious as it was beautiful.\n\nI will be back.  Thank you for an evening of culinary bliss and thoughtful service Aquaknox!", "type": "review", "business_id": "voPFKvVFm7b01xUyJixFYA"}

Of course we were expecting to pay tourist prices when we ate here, but we still wished that the quality of food was satisfactory. I'm not going to lie, I was very impressed with their beautiful display cases of baked cakes and pastries, but looks are definitely deceiving. \n\nTheir cold sandwiches were about $9 each and they were pre wrapped in a clear plastic. They looked like they were made way in advance in a distant warehouse. We could tell they weren't fresh as the bread was damp and soggy. The flavor and ingredients used in the sandwiches were not the greatest quality nor were they fresh. \n\nWe chose the Prosciutto and pickle sandwich and also the Chicken breast pesto.\n\nThe prosciutto was dried out, stringy, and nearly impossible to chew. The pickles were interesting and fun as they were whole mini pickles, yet they were awkward to eat because they kept falling out of the sandwich. \n\nThe chicken pesto sandwich had dry chunks of cold chicken breast, 1 thin piece of iceberg lettuce, and a tiny bit of mayo pesto spread that was so indistinct, I could barely taste any. It was a shame that they named it a pesto sandwich, when it really wasn't. \n\nEven the vanilla iced latte was a failure. They put it in a clear plastic cup with the awkward dome cap which made it spill out everywhere and got everything sticky. It also didn't blend well with the condense milk that they put in it, so my first sip was a punch in the face of condense milk. Note- I didn't taste any vanilla. \n\nThe croissant was very dry as well. When we tried to tear off pieces to share it, it would crumble into a million little pieces of croissant dust.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tz1OiXy_smAtZx80oRQttQ"}

My husband and I had lunch there. What a disappointment that was. We were seated and waited for 15 minutes, still no server. I called over another server from across the room and asked who our server was. He pointed over to a young girl who was standing up against the wall talking, giggling and flirting with a male server. She had been over there the whole time and I didn't realize she was our server. Well things changed pretty quickly when I walked over to her and asked if we could get served because our lunch time was running out and we had already been there waiting for 15 minutes. No apology, just a little snicker and smile at the guy she had been talking too. After this experience, I didn't want to ever go back there. Well, this past weekend, we were in the area for business and my husband talked me into giving it another try. Another big disappointment! It was crowded but we were able to be seated after a 15 minute wait. The problem began with that. The hostess took us the wrong way and when she turned around to go the right way, five different servers got in the way and blocked me from following my husband and the hostess. One male server was even rude and made a nasty comment to me as I tried to make my way past them. One of the female servers giggled at his comment and shoved me into the wall. I lost sight of where my husband and the hostess went. I was so frustrated that I went back to the front of the resturant and just sat down to wait for the hostess to come back. She totally ignored me when she came back up to the station. I sat there for 10 minutes, texting my husband and then finally called him. It was so noisy he couldn't hear his phone at first. He finally came up and got me and took me back to our table. The person who brings chips and salsa and the male server who took our order were the best things about this place. They were both hispanic and a little older. The rest of the staff here look like a bunch of high school kids and they act like it as well. Very rude! Now on to the food- very bland, no flavor. My stuffed quesedilla had no flavor to it what so ever. Taco Bell serv es more flavorful stuff than this place. As my husband was trying to eat his fajita's, the bus boy-another young kid, took his basket of tortillas. He called out to the guy to bring them back and was just ignored. He had to wait for 10 minutes to hail our server and get more tortillas to finish his meal. The best thing about our meal was the beer and the strawberry marguerita. I can honestly say this place is a major disappointment and they are truly lucky that I am retired from broadcasting because I would certainly share my views on the airwaves. They should understand the first rule of any business, treat the customer with respect and don't be rude. Learn some manners. As we walked into the parking lot, we were discussing what just happened and we were overheard by someone apparently in management as she was unloading her car. She followed us and stopped us. She mentioned what she overheard and asked us for more information. We shared our experiences for both times we came here. She then said that they just had a staff meeting a week prior to discuss those very issues. REALLY????? Wow! Apparently the staff didn't listen and they obviously don't care about their reputation or how to treat people. After hearing this, I definitely know that I will never recommend this place to anyone nor will I ever step foot in there again. A real shame.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AC1xogsITgaae5ic8B9Ryw"}

I really liked how they didn't over-sauce the dish. I hate it when my food is drowning in sauce.\n\nCocktails were excellent. Both their primo margarita and mojiito were some of the best ones I've had in a while.\n\nThe service wasn't bad either. After telling the guy we had Groupons, I expected to be ignored all night.

They've got sorbets as well, with a number of fruity flavors. The cost is a bit steep (about $4) for a \"single scoop,\" but they actually give you two fair scoops, so it's not so bad. The flavor is great, especially since the summers are so hot in Nevada.\n\nDecoration is awesome, but the service is kinda whack. The cashiers aren't so nice all the time, but it's not a huge deal.

Iced tea glasses were replaced before finishing the one we were drinking, water glasses were kept filled, and the table was cleaned between each course with politeness and great finesse.\n\nThe dishes were all very good.  The only dish I thought wasn't very successful were the lobster tacos.  The bruschetta was excellent.  I asked about the round yogurt balls in EVOO and the server explained the technique for making them.  Spread on the grilled bread and topped with some blackberry jam, marvelous!  Not to be outdone, the prosciutto wrapped dates with chorizo were large and very tasty.\n\nIn the main, the duck was wonderfully done with a crispy skin and the waffles were quite good.  The amazing thing was the 100 day dry aged ribeye, something that we were told was a special.  It was tomahawk style, sliced from the accompanying bone as providing approximately a dozen medium rare slices of delicious beef with a flavor I haven't enjoyed before not having had beed aged that amount of time.\n\nThe desserts were amazing, too!  My favorite was the warm banana bread pudding with coconut ice cream and Malibu Anglaise.  The doughnuts were very good as was the s'mores.  Any one of the three would be worthy choices.\n\nTwo and a half hours later, we left, quite full and with a big smile from the delightful meal we had just finished.

Here is where the problems started occurring . We waited 20 minutes for the server to come to place our order.  By the time I had placed my order, I was full off of the OJ.  Once I ordered, I waited another 25 minutes for my food to come out.  I had ordered the New York Steak and it was cooked inside correctly, but unfortunately, it was cold.  The plate was hotter than the steak.  My sides were horrendous as they were bland and cold as well.  I don't think I'll be eating here again. By the way, I'm not that hard to please as I spent the weekend eating Nathan's Hot Dogs and Panda Express.  That should testify how bad the food/service here was!", "type": "review", "business_id": "vaq5SJubaZjIoGhgkwxxUA"}

It never disappoints and always has a great variety of food. The last time i was here was about 5 years ago and i heard from some friends that they did a little make over and added alot more food as well. Woah, wait how can they possiby fit anymore food stations in here, they have almost every kind of food knowen to man errr women to be matter of fact! But i guess not!  We decided to start our buffet challange here. And let me tell you when you come to the Carnival make sure you have alot of patience because it takes a little while to actually get seated. When we arrived after paying for our dealio, we stood in line for a good 20-25minutes waiting to be seated along with the other's who were also waiting in line. It seemed like it was slow inside the buffet and there were tables and booths that were open. Maybe they were understaffed that day. There was one hostess who was working the three lines of people. One at a time she would ask how many in the party then let you go, wait another 5 mintues then go to the next line and repeat! Come on lady we have 4 very hungry Yelper waiting to get their hungry hungry hippo on!!!  At last we were finally seated.\nOut waiter was nice, took our orders for drinks (non alcoholic). It took him a little while but we finally got our order. If you want alcoholic drinks the bar is located in the middle of the buffet and is pretty reasonable priced. They have drink special just about every half hour as well.\n\nInstead of telling you what i ate: Here are some of the highlights that they have here:\n\nCarving station that serves Prime rib and Ham. I had a slice of both, the prime rib was so overcooked that it was a challange to cut it so i gave up! The ham was cooked prefect and tasted yummy!\n\nMashed potatoes, ribs, and assorted vegetables\n\nSushi ( I wouldnt recommend it)\n\nHush puppies, onion rings, and shrimp,fried fish fillets,taquitos and wings\n\nAnorexic crab legs, peel-and-eat shrimp and Scallops\n\nA full salad bar\n\nPancakes, Eggs, Waffles, Bagels, Muffins, Lox, Cream Cheese, Omelettes, Hash Browns, Bacon Bacon Bacon!!\n\nPlenty of pasta with various sauces in case you want to make your own\n\nPizza of all kinds\n\nEgg rolls and various dim sum and even BBQ pork! \n\nMade-to-order stations were popular and served: \nPho \nStir-fry\n\nTacos that you can build yourself and quesadillas\n\nDesserts:\nA gelato bar serves eight different flavors\nVarious mini cheesecakes\nSlices of pie and cakes\nFresh Fruit\nRaspberry filled churros\nCookies\nCream Puffs\nBananas foster\n\nThey also have alot of sugar free desserts as well!!\n\nBetween the four of us we totally killed the buffet, and walked away in total buffet coma's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ngNvH4sxnH9aMukTZ67R_Q"}

I think we got there just in time since we didn't have to wait for a table.\n\nI ordered a french pressed coffee soon as I got to the table. It was perfect to start my brunch. \n\nSince we didn't have an idea on what to order, we just asked for recommendations. The server was so knowledgable of the menu. She gave us recommendations on every part of the menu. We decided to order tuna tartare & guacamole for starters, Chilaquiles and Short ribs for our entree.\n\nThe tartare & guacamole was big enough to share. The guacamole was placed on top of the tuna tartare. I would have wanted a little more seasoning on my guacamole and maybe a little bit of a kick. Maybe some chili peppers would do. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. I just had better tuna tartare and guacamole.\n\nThe short ribs at $20+ was tender, juicy and full of flavour. It was served on top of mashed potatoes and some grilled carrots. Again, it was around $20+... I can have the same good meal for $12 and still get the same satisfaction.\n\nThe chilaquiles was a different story. I think it's appropriately priced for the size and the flavour. I enjoyed the crunch of the corn tortilla, the balance of the chicken flavour and the compliment of the spicy sauce. It was original. At least it was the first time I had a mexican lasagna made with corn tortilla, chicken and spicy sauce.\n\nOverall, Chelsea's kitchen had its pros and cons. The pros outweighs the cons. It may be pricey, it may have an ordinary menu but if you dig in just a little bit more... you might find some good food.\n\nI will still come back to Chelsea's. Maybe next time i'll try the short ribs taco. The next table ordered it and it looked amazing.\n\nBy the way, they give free cookies on your way out. It was really good. Maybe the best thing I ate at Chelsea's that day were the cookies. Take note, THAT DAY. Maybe it would be different the next time I visit.\n\nmore reviews on \nhttp://themealexperience.blogspot.com/", "type": "review", "business_id": "3oZcTGb_oDHGwZFiP-7kxQ"}

At first I was a little hesitant to try Indian food, but what better way to try it than with my Indian BF and his entourage of cousins, aunties, uncles and parents? We came here one Saturday evening for dinner and I fell in love with the setting. It's nothing like restaurants you see on the strip. It had a buffet, large lounge love seats with over stuffed pillows and an orange and gold scheme that made you feel like you were in India itself (or so I imagined).\nBeing with the crowd I was with, it was great because some of them were not too fond of extremely spicy food so we got a lot of mild dishes. You can just tell the staff to make it mild and they will do so. The vegetarian dishes were great. We started off with dishes like the Kurkari Bhindi- okra with brown onions and had chicken tikka for our entree.  The Naan had a great texture for scooping up all the sauce left over. I really enjoyed the dining experience and I think that I owe my love for Indian food to this restaurant.\n\nThis is a great for a first timer!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2dioqPw6txEgB397frYg-A"}

By this time we were STARVING so I whip out my trusty iPhone and used my Yelp app to find this place just across the street. It's located in the Hawaiian Marketplace all the way in the back.\n\nThe first thing we did after we entered was pay the $15 for the weekend lunch buffet. I thought that was a bit strange but if the hotel buffet places can do it why not. \n\nThey had a lot of variety, at least 14 different items, and thought everything was just ok. One thing I thought was really good was their upma, it's like an Indian version of the Moroccan cous cous. It was my first time having the dish and it was simple yet very tasty. The chicken tandoori had good flavor but was a little dry. The chicken tikka masala sauce was good but there wasn't a lot of chicken, I had to dig around for some. What I noticed is that this place supplied small containers for the different dishes. I've never seen that before and thought it's a good idea for those who don't like mixing their food. \n\nThey were pretty good with refilling our water cups and clearing our dirty plates. Bad thing with this buffet was drinks weren't included so a separate bill was handed to us. Another downside was the food wasn't labeled properly, so I was just grabbing things blindly. \n\nOverall it was just an OK experience. At least Tamba introduced me to a new dish, now all I have to do is find it here in LA!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2dioqPw6txEgB397frYg-A"}

I should say \"we\" had the shrimp ceviche as there was easily enough for two.  It, too, was delicious.  HIs entree was the carne asada.  I did not try, but he commented the steak was seasoned nicely and not overdone for a change.  I had the green chile pork roast which was chucks of perfectly tender pork in a spicy, but not too hot, green chile sauce.  For dessert he had the buttermilk pie, and I can't remember mine, because his was better.  I hate when that happens.\n\nAnd I almost forgot the best part....the tortillas!!!  While not Carolina's, these are a little thicker and really, really good with the little toasty brown spots from being warmed over an open flame.  It was so good, I purposely saved half to eat with my leftovers.  But our server was so awesome that when he boxed up my food and I asked him to please include my tortilla, he gave me a brand new one, too!

I had been here over 10 years ago and while I liked the food, the loud bar customers and louder music were a complete annoyance.  I never thought I'd return.\n\nI had a reservation for 5 PM which would give me plenty of time for the 7 PM show.  As the hostess was walking with me, she asked if I wanted bar seating for happy hour or did I want dinner seating in the downstairs dining room.  Bingo!  Downstairs to avoid any loudness!  I never knew it existed.\n\nDown about 7 steps is a large room off the pool at TI and this is there main dining room.  I was seated halfway in the dining room and I had a good view toward both one pool area and the stairs.  Right in front of me was a TV with Monday Night football so that took my attention.  \n\nRowan was my server and he was there soon with menu and took my order for iced tea.  After looking things over and asking about the soup of the day, I opted for chicken tortilla soup to start and Bang Bang shrimp for the main course.\n\nThe chicken tortilla soup is listed on the menu as spicy but it wasn't--at least not for me.  The soup was very hot and it was good.  The chicken was a bit meager.  There were some tortilla chips standing in the bowl instead of the normal tortilla strips most places use.  This was good.  At this time came the only glitch in service.  Before I finished my soup, a runner came from the kitchen with my main course.  Damn, I wish restaurants would watch this.  If I hadn't been somewhat close to finishing my soup, I would have sent her back.  But then, it would probably sit under a heat lamp for a few minutes.\n\nThe Bang Bang shrimp was very good and a reason to return.  The dish consists of 8 shrimp with bacon, zucchini, yellow squash, broccoli, red pepper, and carrots.  The shrimp have a nice spicy zest to them making their bang bang name appropriate.  The rice appeared to be regular rice rather than jasmine and the shrimp wasn't served over a bed of rice as the menu states, but it was a good looking dish with an orchid in the rice.  Nice touch.\n\nFor dessert, I got the pineapple upside down cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was OK and something different.\n\nService was very good.  Rowan brought a new iced tea before I finished the first one and he asked if I wanted a cup to take my leftover iced tea with me.  His service was very good and he was a very personable and polite man.\n\nOn the way out, the hostess wished me a good evening and used my name which was a very nice touch.  This is a place to which I'd return if I were coming to TI, not something I do very often.", "type": "review", "business_id": "f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw"}

Fresco is super modern, minimalist, and actually quite intimate when you eliminate the outdoor seating due to the cold weather. Best view in Madison?

I was browsing the menu, which I came upon a unique omelet Ive never seen else were. CHILI CHEESE OMELET for BREAKFAST?!?

Honestly, I could have counted to 200 and been notified that my food was ready.\n\nEating my CHILI CHEESE OMELET... it was FANTASTIC! It was made of egg (your normal egg omelet) which had green peppers inside and full of chili.

Normally some places like this get kind of cranky if you order that close to closing, but the lady who helped me was so nice.  I believe her name is Nahren....one of the owners.\n\nI had the Dolmeh (grape leaves) appetizer and the Gyros entree.  The Dolmeh, which was served warm, was pretty darn good, a little different than I've had it before, but the style can vary based on which country the recipe is originating from...in this case Iran I believe.  It's hard to really screw up gyros, and gyros meat will be pretty consistent in taste no matter where you go.  But here, there was something that separated it from the rest, it was really flavorful.  The gyros comes with sides of pita to wrap it in, tzatziki sauce, onions, tomatoes...and is all served over amazingly delicious basmati rice with golden raisins and almonds in it. Sooo good.\n\nWhen the food was ready and I got the bill it was like $23 something.  I thought wow, this is kinda expensive...but when I got home and opened my food, I was blown away at how HUGE the portions were.  I got at least 3 meals for myself out of it.

My wife and I have heard nothing but great things about their dinner and last week she chose to go here for her birthday.\n\nFirst off, I have to say the ambiance and overall feel of the place is amazing. One of, if not, the best dining rooms in Madison. The service was good, not overly friendly but overall efficient. Although, I think she forgot to put our entree's in until well after our appetizer arrived. The table next to us ordered at the same time we did and they were on dessert by the time our entrees came. \n\nThe food was, well...disappointing! We started with the grilled shrimp, polenta, and pancetta app. Easily the highlight of the meal, the shrimp was well cooked and the creamy polenta was absolutely perfect. Our only complaint here being; for $13 we thought they could have served up more than two shrimp on the dish. I made a joke that they needed to change the name on the menu to creamy parmesan polenta with shrimp. I mean, what's the food cost on that plate for polenta? About .40 cents? \n\nFor Entree's my wife ordered the Pan Fried Chicken Paillard. I had the Pan Roasted White Fish and a side of Frites. My wife's chicken was cooked well and perfectly crispy, but otherwise flavorless. She said the ratatouille was the highlight of the dish because it actually had some flavor. I ran into the same problem with my white fish, it was virtually flavorless as were the fava beans it laid on, and the garlic bread crumbs were almost non existent on the dish. My dish was lacking so much in flavor that it forced me to keep salting and peppering until i went too far and over salted. The frites were cooked well and seasoned properly, but...seriously!?!? Where's the aioli? They serve their frites with, what tastes like, straight out of the jar mayonnaise. I don't mind mayo with my frites but for a \"French\" restaurant, serving frites with a side of Hellmans, I have to say, \"FAIL!\" They seemed pretty popular too, as three of the tables around us had ordered them. An aioli seems like a simple improvement. The portion sizes are nothing spectacular, either. My wife and I shared the frites and were both glad I ordered them. I think we would have left hungry without them. My wife was also quick to point out that half of their entrees are ripped straight out of an Eric Ripert cookbook. She proved this to me when we got home.\n\nOverall, Sardine, we still love your brunch and will be back, but for a nice dinner at your price point...you will not be our first choice, or second, or third. This decision is based solely on the food. Perhaps I should just learn my lesson and avoid seafood all together in the mid-west, or maybe I went into this place with too high of expectations.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rXEGCpdboVwczMIDZuXXaA"}

We waited about 10 minutes to be seated.\n\nOur server was fantastic and very attentive.  I always had a new diet coke before my other one was empty.  My mama's water glass was always topped off.  The server also brought out a complimentary dessert with a candle and sang happy birthday with me!\n\nThe food was just okay to me.  It wasn't stellar, but wasn't bad.  The bread came out hot and fresh and the dipping spices with EVOO was great.  I ordered a pizza from their wood-fired oven and while the crust was great, the middle of the pizza was kind of soggy.  It wasn't bad, just not great.  I would definitely try something different in the future.  My mom ordered the chicken parmigiana.  It comes with a side and my mom chose mashed potatoes.  We both expected that the chicken would sit atop a bed of noodles, but apparently that has to be your side for it to be so?  I'm not sure, but it just looked silly on the plate like that.  I tried a bite and the chicken was really good.\n\nWhat really stood out, though, was the dessert.  The complimentary dessert we received was two scoops of vanilla Bluebell ice cream (which our server claims you can only find in Texas and Carrabba's restaurants, but I think I've seen it in grocery stores before..) with candied pecans and a caramel-y kind of sauce.  It was outstanding!  Perfect for my mom too, since she loves pecans.\n\nOverall, I'd rate the service a 5, dessert a 5, and the food a 3.  There's definitely better Italian food at non-chains, but it's still not a terrible option.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cTz7lxA0AdWKMba6Bvsi3g"}

I think the food is great! I get together with family we always get some appetizers start our dinner. We had the calamari and zucchini fries. The calamari thing enjoy or stood out unlike other chain italian restaurants each piece was nicely coated with breaded and no clumps of calamari. The marinara sauce was ok. Just preference like marinara with calamari not so chunky. The zucchini fries cut just like regular fries was fabulous and the dipping sauce was awesome. \n\nEntree apparently there running seasonal specials menu now. Pastas second section on the menu. You get two bowls of pasta for one price. I tried the bolognese. I enjoyed! It was nice meaty tomato sauce. Pasta was cooked nice al dente. Scoop of ricotta cheese on top. The portion sizes at Carrabba's is very generous. Definitely getting money worth comes too food. The bread is really good. End up getting two of three portions every time. I like the fact the bread comes with nice olive oil and herbs instead of butter. \n\nThe service always been great. Our waiter was wonderful he took care of us. Never had empty glass, constantly checking up making sure things were great. He never minded fact we hoarding loaf after loaf of bread. We ordered food too go for my sister-in-law and he timed it out perfectly he brought our check food all packed ready too go. If never been too Carrabba's its not whole lot different then Olive Garden (I am fan) prices about the same, lot of food, and great for family night out. Carrabba's different vibe inside and sure the bread take over Olive Garden. It place that will be coming back again with family.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cTz7lxA0AdWKMba6Bvsi3g"}

I had dined here three times before, but not for a long while. The ambiance is all Old Vegas, the period when the Rat Pack ruled the Strip. Paintings of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr. grace the walls, along with a young Elvis and Howard Hughes in his adult prime. Encased in glass at the northeast tip of Fashion Show, the restaurant features dark woods and has a formal feel to it. Chairs mostly fashioned of wood have fabric inserts on top and soft leather seats, while booths are all decorated in leather. From our comfortable seats we had a good view of Encore just across the street. \n\nWe opened with Pan Fried Calamari that was sauteed in Garlic Butter. Even though the chef was kind enough to accommodate my request for an aioli by producing an excellent Pepper Aioli, the calamari was the worst dish of the night. The cooking of this appetizer was very uneven. A few pieces were clearly undercooked. Some tentacles were too chewy, and were difficult to tear apart with hand or teeth and swallow. The calamari rings were much better! \n\nA large, seemingly bottomless crock of French Onion Soup, with nicely melted Havarti Cheese, well-caramelized onions, and suitably broken down bread in the broth, was excellent. So was a cup of good and creamy New England-style Clam Chowder with a sweet clam taste as morsels of clam flattened out on the roof of the mouth and disintegrated on their way down the throat.  A chopped Caesar salad, prepared with sections of fresh Romaine Lettuce, tasty crust-like croutons, Parmesan Cheese shavings, and a delicate Caesar dressing, was also excellent. \n\nMy medium-rare Parmesan and Herb Marinated Tournedos were very good but not great. The meat seemed under-seasoned except for enough pepper. Halves of warm red and yellow Cherry and Grape Tomatoes adorned the plate. A thicker than normal au jus was substituted for unavailable requested Bordelaise Sauce. A superb Bearnaise Sauce was also provided without charge on request. But the Parmesan Cheese shavings were exactly like those that topped the Caesar Salad just a course before, which soon became too much a dose of Parmesan Cheese. Accompanying mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were delicious sides. Sam's Mashed Potatoes were Red Bliss Potatoes blended with sweet cream, butter, and salt; while the Fresh Creamed Spinach consisted of lengths of cooked spinach blended with Bechamel Sauce. \n\nThis meal was finished with an orgy of desserts!  A generous and densely packed slice of Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake with coconut whipped cream, raspberries, and raspberry gel, plus added Vanilla Ice Cream, contained just the right amount of coffee flavoring, and was a decadent dessert. And, Classic Vanilla Creme Brulee prepared in a large dish was also excellent. Because it was the end of Restaurant Week, I also partook of some offered tasty blackberries and cool blueberries. \n\nService was superb all night! Not once did I have to ask for a glass of water or Iced Tea to be refilled. Our tall assistant server seemed to be always hovering nearby, quick to bring a pitcher as soon as one was even about to be needed. And, once my Iced Tea was replenished with fresh ice in a new glass. Packets of Sweet & Low were added by our always observant server Nicole. And, a whole new bread basket packed with Lavosh was brought to the table after we requested some more. Then, after meal's end, the Lavosh that we didn't eat was neatly packed for us in a box. A manager also stopped by to check on us during the course of the meal. \n\nThe Capital Grille is a classy steakhouse that we will be sure to frequent again. Other signature dishes like Butter Poached and Broiled Fresh Lobster, King Crab Legs, cheesy Au Gratin Potatoes, and a knockout Chocolate Hazelnut Cake beckon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lyC2KqGiFIwct39jbdIdJg"}

Perhaps I shouldn't black ball this place any longer?? Help me to over come!! \n\n\nWell, I never! LOL! Tradiciones.. good food, good service, if you're Hispanic.. I sent an email to the manager with no reply and no surprise. I thought I would share my experience with you.\n\nDear Mr Braden,\n\nI wanted to share our experience last night at Tradiciones with you. We have several friends coming in from out of town so the past Friday I had lunch and your wonderful restaurant. My friend and I had a exceptional time with great service (Mario was our sever) spot on menu items and overall were both very impressed. So I went ahead and made a reservation for a party of 15 with much excitement and anticipation. This type of excitement comes from years of dining and being a huge food enthusiast or foodie as my friends call me. This experience is in stark contrast to what happened last night.\n\nMy excitement carried with me the whole weekend so I decided to take my significant other there to have the same pleasure I had. Upon arrival we were amazed how busy it was and knew that a wait was imminent. After about 10 minutes I was able to make it to the front desk to put my name in for a table for 2. The hostess smiled at me and I told her 'dos', she raised her finger up to me and said \"uno momento\". Then she walked off and got another hostess, this was confusing as when she returned she started taking names of other guests and ignored me. Finally the new hostess asked me what I wanted. I told her I wanted a table for 2 she then told me that there was at least an hour wait. This was pretty obvious judging from the tens of other folks waiting for a table. Meanwhile the other hostess continued taking names then finally she added mine. I told her that we were actually here before the other guests the other hostess had written down. She ignored this and put my name on the bottom of the list. I'm not sure why she was acting like this towards me as there didn't seem to be a problem with any other guest besides the fact that I didn't speak Spanish. Our first instinct was to simply leave as it was perceived by us that we weren't welcome here. We stayed as the atmosphere still seemed lively and the smell coming from the grills were intoxicating.\n\nAfter walking around the courtyard and enjoying some of the vendor stalls there we decided to venture back in so we wouldn't be missed. As we were standing there waiting I noticed that the patio only had a few tables and wasn't very busy at all. So we asked the second hostess if we could sit out there. She came back several minutes later to tell us the patio was understaffed and she couldn't seat us there though she offered bar seats instead. Perfect! We we're sat at the bar and were both excited to try the Cilantro Margarita! We ordered then, I saw her mixing it up, my mouth started to drool. She  then presented the drinks to us, cheers!  The drinks were wonderful and I'm not a big sweet drink fan. I then looked straight ahead and saw our bartender enter an order into the computer. As I watched her type I was amazed to notice that she named the check \"Dos Gringo's\"! Looking around I could tell she was referring to us as everyone else around us looked to have been there for a while. She turned around and I asked her \"Dos Gringo's\"? She smiled and started laughing like I caught her doing something wrong. She tried to explain that she gives everyone nick names and didn't make any apologies to us for the name.\n\nIs it acceptable to call your non Spanish speaking guests Gringo's? I felt this was very offensive as I have generally heard the word in derogatory terms. Though this seemed to make sense as the way were treated at the hostess desk, were we just not welcome here? I continued to stew on this experience all the way until this morning when finally I decided to look up the word gringo to see if I were off base for my feelings. This is what I found...\n\ngringo(gr&#301;ng'g&#333;) n.pl. gringos Offensive Slang, Used as a disparaging term for a foreigner in Latin America, especially an American or English person.\n\nThis solidified my feelings so I finally did some soul searching and decided to share our experience.

I don't know if this is true but they sucked the Mexican soul out of this place (whoever they are). The food, well, it is not Mexican food. They replaced the salsa with some weird watered down sauce with some stuff floating in it and that is their only salsa. They don't make a hot sauce for us gringas who like spicy. We ordered the Chili con Queso as an appetizer, for $8, it was a huge rip off. It was about 2 tablespoons of room temp melted cheese. My daughter's cheese nachos were 4 chips with melted white cheese that had NO flavor. My chili relleno had no flavor at all and about halfway through, had the flavor of cleaning product. I verified this with friend who was choking down his weird enchiladas (no other way to describe them). The manager said they got rid of the hot salsa and took $3 off my dinner for the cleaning product relleno. This place has turned into a huge joke.

The service was incredibly slow. Our first dish was the chicken lettuce wraps. The white noodle crisps that come with the chicken lettuce wraps were so hard and burnt, and when my mom ate some of them in her wrap, she chipped her tooth! We politely told our waitress about it, and she just LAUGHED and walked away. No apology, no \"I'll talk to the cook about that.\" It's like that was her plan all along , and she was so happy that customers were receiving bodily harm from the food. The rest of the food took forever to arrive, to the point where we eventually had to find SOMEONE that passed by to ask what was going on. The sea bass that arrived was the worst cooked fish we've ever tasted. It tasted old, rough, and the spinach it came with was the worst spinach ever (the sauce tasted like a cigarette,  the spinach was raw, and parts of it had giant amounts of salt piled on!). I mean, how do you screw up spinach? I've tasted this same dish at the P.F. Chang's at King of Prussia in Pennsylvania, and it tastes so much better and so completely different. Our mongolian beef dish here was very rough and again had an overwhelming amount of burnt white noodle crisps. The only dish that was semi-edible was the beef lo mein, and even that had a lot of salt. Our waitress eventually came over to ask how we were liking the food, and we hesitated. We could kind of predict that she would just laugh and walk away. But she kept standing there, so we eventually told her the spinach was too salty and under cooked. And guess what - she laughed and walked away. Again.\n\nAwful service, awful food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xcOncADGPr9eki8OU5Ln7g"}

Nice, real nice.\n\nOh, and stop comparing Asian restaurants to Panda Express- it's getting old.\n\nFirst off, you can obviously tell that I love this place.  Let me tell you why.\n\nEven during the first time I ate at Tao, I didn't expect it to be a quaint and gentle dinner made by a world-renowned chef.  Tao's advertisements have a naked woman with \"Always a happy ending\" tatooed to her back in Chinese.  Seriously, what did you expect?  If you think that kind of lewd advertisement says, \"Bob and Daisy's Kosher Garden Cafe,\" I'll fly myself to your city to slap you.\n\nI came there and got what I expected and a bit more.  Stunning interior design by a NY firm whose design philosophy is heavily based on catering to the audience.  From the dramatic lighting, the 2-story buddha, and the naked girls in the bathtubs at the tunnel entrance- if you think you can take your grandma on her tennis-ball walker to this restaurant, you deserve a second slap.\n\nAs far as the food goes, it was fine.  Yes, I could've gotten better food at an off-strip restaurant, but was I there mainly to have the ultimate epicurean experience?  Absolutely not, I was there to eat, enjoy the energy of the restaurant and most importantly, to have fun with my friends.\n\nWhat, you're gonna give a restaurant who serves amazing food 5 stars even when the food is served on paper plates and they're located in a rat-infested hole in the wall with horrible servers?  Don't be ridiculous.\n\nAs far as the service goes, I'll admit- it's not flawless.  They do know a lot about the menu and about Japanese and pan-Asian cuisine, and they're quite attentive.  But the hostesses could be a bit more polite.  You know why they're ticked off by the end of the night?\n\nImagine yourself as a tall blonde girl with 32C's, getting drunk calls at all hours of the night, getting hit on and gropped by the occasional stranger.. and hassled by the idiot who decided to bring their 3 year old child and needs a baby seat.\n\nOf course, this is no excuse for the management to hire more enduring hostesses, but they don't care.  The money is coming, and they still remain as one of the most highest earning on the strip in terms of annual revenue.\n\nAnyways, you've heard it all.  I love this place because it's a place I can enjoy inexpensive food (seriously, $12 pad thai isn't that much on the Vegas strip), amazing interior, decent service, with people I know who can enjoy it with me.\n\nYou want amazing food, go to Joel Robuchon.  But be prepared- I don't think Joel himself will come out to thank your granddaughter for eating at his place on her baptism day since obviously, that's what you expect of Tao.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gGeVLZ9j_wAYKbaqgnKSJA"}

We ended up ordering a few more appetizers and they all came out together. The appetizers were fine, (satay chicken, dumplings) no complaints there. However, I was not impressed with my dinner. Feeling adventurous, (I usually stick to a rice dish with chicken) I decided to try the Pho. When our entrees arrived, my Pho was presented in a bowl with a large amount of broth. It wasn't very pleasing to the eye as the broth was clear and the noodles and sprouts were white. My biggest criticism though is the amount of beef in the Pho. I would expect to see only a few bites of beef if this were an appetizer but not an entree. The dish was mainly vermicelli and sprouts which would have been much better if the broth it was in had more flavor. I could not taste the garlic or the beef in the broth. Well, I couldn't taste much of anything in the broth. I added some sweet chili paste to spice it up a notch but even with the paste the flavor was very one dimensional. My dinning companions were equally unimpressed with their meals with the exception of the chicken pineapple which had large chunks of chicken and great flavors.

I decided to give the place a try with its Restaurant Week menu and I was not disappointed.\n\nCourse 1 was crispy calamari with a lemon and curry aioli and some haricot verts.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and I liked that besides rings they had tentacles mixed in.  The lemon and curry aioli was a very tasty dipping sauce.  5/5\n\nCourse 2 was veal scaloppini with crimini mushrooms, lemon, marsala and capellini with olive oil.  The marsala sauce was superb in its richness and the crimini mushrooms added god flavor.  The capellini was a bit bland.  It needed some salt and for my taste a bit of grated cheese to bring out the richness of the olive oil.  4.5/5\n\nCourse 3 was a dessert of a gorgonzola panna cotta with a cherry compote and some sesame tuile.  The panna cotta was very light as it should be and had a mild flavor.  The cherry compote paired well with the lightness of the panna cotta.  The tuile was placed across the plate in the panna cotta.  Presentation was quite nice.\n\nThe restaurant is beautifully decorated.  I appreciate the fact that they start dinner service at 4.  I had a reservation for 4:30 as I needed to eat, run home and put my shorts back on, and head to a play at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park.  Service was excellent.  My server was polite and efficient.  The music loop was more for gray hairs like me.  The place was quiet, but it was early and there weren't many diners yet.

In general I'd give a place like this a 3, but the service definitely warranted takes another star away...\n\nOnce we placed our \"cheapo\" order (we only spent $150 between the 2 of us.. wow we are such cheapskates), the waiter gave us a rude look and disappeared for the night. He literally never came back. Our baked potato was served without any toppings, our water was never refilled.. it was awful. We literally had to hunt someone down 15 minutes after our potato was delivered to ask for some butter and sour cream. UGH. \n\nThe worst part was we had a $25 giftcard as part of a package at Red Rock. They took the card, and then the next day when we went to check out, we saw they had made their tip on a $150 meal over $50... they had just applied the gift card to their tip. Are you kidding me? It took waayyyy too much fighting and hassle to get our $25 back. The front desk was rude, didn't believe us, etc, etc.. What a pain!\n\nOverall there are sooo many places in Vegas to eat an average steak (like Hugo's for instance), you might as well eat at one with good service too! If you want an amazing jaw dropping steak, there are plenty of places for that as well (Craftsteak, Strip Steak, etc, etc). Why settle for an average steak in a crappy place?

Avoid! (2).\n\nI've never been a real fan of steakhouses however we recently received a coupon in the mail for $25 off $50 purchase at T-bones. The hubs previously had been there for their happy hour specials and suggested we do this because their regular menu is vastly overpriced. As well, he stipulated that we were not to go on Friday because they charge extra tax for live entertainment. Not usually one to enjoy live music with dinner (I'm more a quiet sort), I agreed.\n\nSo we get there right at 5pm and put down our order: a Beef on Weck ($19), Ahi Tuna tacos ($9), Buffalo Chicken Bites ($10), Chicken and Waffles ($10) and Lobster Corn Dogs ($10).\n\nI have no idea what they were thinking charging this much for such subpar cuisine. \n\nBeef on Weck = Beef on Wreck. It was essentially overcooked prime rib on the equivalent of a Wonderbread bun smothered in bland (thickened with corn starch) au jus. The amount of au jus just killed the dish, making the bread all weird and mucky. It reminded me of the sh*(ty recipes they made us try during home ec class from like a 50's cookbook (let's make Welsh rarebit using Velveta - nasty!). Albeit it was large and came with fries, I'd wager you'd get a better beef sammy at Arbys for about 1/4 of the price. Lame!\n\nThe buffalo chicken bites although the flavors were okay, the lack of crispiness really killed it. If you are going to deep fry chicken bites, I want to taste to deep fried goodness. Otherwise what's the point of adding all those extra calories?\n\nLobster corn dogs were also very weak = too much coating, too little lobster plagued this completely forgettable dish. It comes with two small lobster corndogs.\n\nAhi Tuna Tacos were okay. There were three small tacos, with some low grade ahi-tuna dressed with avocado. Solid but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere.\n\nThe chicken and waffles were also edible and possibly the best dish of the night. The coating of the chicken was okay and the hit of the jalapeno was nice. The waffle was nothing special and I would argue hit too heavily on the vanilla side. I'm not so sure but as a rule: vanilla + savory = bleh. 'Nuff said.\n\nOverall, given the subpar food alone - I would generally not recommend this place at all. Throw in the ripe off prices, I'd say avoid this place like the plague. (2 starred review).", "type": "review", "business_id": "4h8_u6Fqm3JvUEq8ctWf-A"}

Situated at The District in Green Valley Ranch, this location is quite big with plenty of seating either the inside dining room or the outdoor patio that can accommodate even a fairly large group.  There's also a nice bar setup with flat screen TVs, making the restaurant a great place to watch any sporting event.\n\nBeing Napoletana, the pizza is cooked for about a minute in a wood-burning oven.  This isn't your typical NY style pizza where it can be picked up and folded in half.  Instead, the use of cutleries is advised while eating this pizza since the crust is thin and soft which doesn't hold up especially if you stock up on toppings.\n\nOut of multiple visits, everything I've had from this place so far has been really good.  I usually like to start with Panzanella or Involtini di Prosciutto.  As far as their pizzas, I prefer the ones with crushed tomatoes: classic Margherita (mozzarella, basil, Parmigiano Regiano), the Carbonara (pancetta, egg, mozzarella) and the Settebello (pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil).  Fresh ingredients, bold flavors and great topping combinations.  I normally have the 12 inch pizza to myself which doesn't leave any room for dessert.  If you can, however, go for their dessert pizza (sliced bananas, drizzle of Nutella and dusted with powdered sugar).\n\nOverall, Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana is definitely one of the best pizza joints in Las Vegas.

I like to get the Caldo De Pollo and a big lado de cilantro which I dump in when I get sick. I always ask for a separate plate because the chicken is essentially poached in the broth and I take the skin and bones off on a plate. It is worth the trouble and comes in a huge steaming bowl with some hot fresh tortillas. I have never been able to finish the whole thing all at once.\nCaldo de Res is a big favorite of the customers here, but I must confess I never have ordered it. It comes accompanied with huge sides of limes and onion and cilantro and Fresh Tortillas.\n\nThe Enchiladas here are Estillo Jalisco and come grilled with sauce on top. More like a quesadilla than a casserole. \n\nFreshly prepared Corn Tortillas really set this apart as my very favorite restaurant for a good hearty Jalisco style breakfast! The beans they serve are incredible too! I am a big fan of huevos rancheros but always opt to leave the rice and cheese off of the plate to save room for a tortilla or two. \nTortillas are natural for sopping up all of the eggy saucy beany goodness!

Having read this, as well as the $110/person \"average check price\" listed on their website, I was somewhat concerned going in, given I had intended on trying the prix fixe menu at $55/person and arriving a bit earlier in order to get some drinks on their happy hour menu. However, I love steak and we were staying at THEhotel, so I really wanted to try an upscale steakhouse nearby, and Stripsteak sounded great for the price.\n\nWhen we got there, there was a slight wait even though we had reservations and the place was clearly empty (common restaurant tactic in order to drive patrons to wait/drink at their bar, which we did). It wasn't a problem as we were planning on trying some of their specialty cocktails on their happy hour menu anyway, and I had budgeted plenty of time for dinner before our Lion King show later in the night. We got to chat up two of the bartenders over a mojito and Stripsteak Sour. Drinks were okay; nothing out of this world. The bartenders were pretty outgoing, though it was obvious they were tired of hearing about what tourists had planned for their trips, even so, they continue to ask.\n\nI have to say, our waiter (Glen H) was awesome the whole night. He was extremely attentive, and we didn't notice any decline in service after we had ordered our meal. He answered questions on the menu items (which I always have at these type of places where they have fancy names for everything), and was around just enough but not too much.\n\nFood is served with a complimentary trio of duck fat fries, which were amazing. I ordered the prix fixe menu as planned and chose the salad wedge, prime rib, and root beer float dessert. My girlfriend ordered the Kobe burger with a side of duck fat fries (we didn't know we would be getting complimentary fries before we had ordered, and she really wanted to try them).\n\nThe meal was excellent. The duck fat fries were a perfect start and the prime rib was surprisingly filling (I got triple sides of mac n cheese as well lol). The root beer float was not my thing. To be honest, I'm not sure how different you can do a root beer float, so I found it somewhat uncharacteristic of this type of restaurant.\n\nAll in all, we kept the bill to $150, and that's with four drinks (a head's up, the specials go from $6 to $13 after 7pm, which I hadn't noticed before we had ordered our seconds). We even had leftovers, though I warn that duck fat fries do not taste good at all cold, so kill these at the restaurant (the fat begins to harden).\n\nI think the prix fixe menu served its purpose in wetting our appetite for Stripsteak. I would love to come back again soon. Nice bar, comfortable seating area. It was a near perfect dinner. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XDYnLQC8ViZejuCDp4eCwg"}

An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be \"way too much\" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take \"about fifteen minutes,\" leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\n\nReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\n\nDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first \"Shirley Temple's Pudding,\" a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of cr\u00e8me anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the cr\u00e8me, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\n\nMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WNy1uzcmm_UHmTyR--o5IA"}

I like my red chile to be a tad thicker in the sauce department and this particular red chile was slightly soupy while relying on the slow cooked beef to carry the dish.  \n\nFor a ten dollar plate, I felt the burro was sort of small.  It came with beans and rice which were also decent but not outstanding.\n\nThey have all kinds of stuff here: tamales, tacos, tostadas, enchiladas, all the usual suspects.  But for my money and my palette, I usually stick with a red chile burrito as a basis for my standard measure.\n\nLa Casa Blanca is a nice spot and the food isn't bad.

We placed our orders and then we waited...and waited...and waited. an hour later our server came back and let us know that our food would be out \"soon\". We had our baby with us so at that point we just wanted to get our food and take it to go. But then he disappeared for another 20 minutes and we still had no food. We saw food come out and other tables (that had arrived after us) were being served, but none of our food had come out.\n\nWhen we finally got our food the order was incomplete. I got my food, which I went about boxing so that we could get going (home), but my wife's meal was MIA. I asked for our portion of the check and we waited some more. Another 20 minutes past and my wife's meal finally came, but was incorrect. She ordered corn tortillas and got flour; she has a gluten allergy and I explained that to the server, but he was unapologetic and stated \"if she doesn't have celiacs disease then she can just push the food off the wheat tortilla\". I told him we won't be doing that and asked him to take the dish back and have it changed to corn. There was further discussion about how \"it was fine\" and that \"I should just take the food\"...he finally reluctantly took the food back. We waited some more.\n\nAt this point my wife and I had had it and we just wanted to leave (without the food) I asked for my credit card back at the front desk (our server had once again disappeared) but the server had the card still. When I finally saw him, he said the food was on it's way. I told him we wanted none of it and we just wanted my card back so that we could go home. I asked if he had charged the card and he said \"no\".\n\nWhen I got home, low and behold there was a hold charge for la Casa Blanca.\n\nNeedless to say we will never be back.

We went off the recommendations of our waitress and loved everything. \n\nWe went with the tapas style menu, with smaller portions, and had 5-6 different dishes.

One of my friends asked me, \"Why haven't you found the best sushi in Phoenix?\"  Lack of urgency?  Needless to say, we began a quest to find the best sushi in Phoenix.  It will be an expensive quest.  And I think we started at the right place.\n\nWe started with the miso soup with clams.  If you want to imagine what miso soup with clam tastes like, imagine taking miso soup, and just adding clams.  I can't really think of any other way to describe it.  It's really that simple.\n\nWhen the waitress took our order, we basically just went to town.  And everything was brought out, for the most part, one at a time.  This gave us time to enjoy each dish, and have a few minutes to think about it before the next item arrived.\n\nThe first dish we had was the ankimo, or steamed monkfish liver.  This delicacy is something I had in Denver, San Diego, and San Francisco.  Here, it was served without ponzu jelly, but otherwise similar.  The others in my party, who hadn't had ankimo before, liked it.\n\nNext, we had hamachi carpaccio, which was a hit.  These perfectly garnished strips of yellowtail were one of the highlights of the night.\n\nAfter that, we had yellowtail tartare.  This got mixed reactions; I'm not sure what they used in the flavoring, but I did like the spicy note that slowly builds up after you eat it.\n\nWe then had the amaebi sushi (shrimp), which was served in two stages: first, the main part of the body, peeled and raw; and finally, the head, deep-fried.  I had deep fried shrimp heads before, but it was a first for my two dining companions.  Really, the head is the most interesting part, and I would highly recommend anybody eating shrimp sushi to go ahead and ask for the fried head.\n\nNext was brought out a whole fried european sea bass.  This was one of the most passable items for me; I usually prefer my fish to be served raw.  It was a nice change from everything else, but I probably won't order that one again... Or maybe I'm just bitter because the fish only had two eyeballs, and I didn't get one of them.\n\nWe then started on a rainbow roll, which the others ordered because they wanted to ensure we had something \"safe.\"  I ate a few pieces, but I never really get excited about rainbow rolls, or really any rolls.\n\nNext they brought out the sushi: we had ocean trout, young yellowtail, and red snapper.  The waitress made sure to mention that they were served with garnishes and sauces, and were not meant to be dipped in additional sauce.  I liked that they were so serious about how the dishes are intended to be eaten; it really highlights the care they take in making the cuisine an actual art form, and not just something to stuff your face with.  My favorite of the three fish was the young yellowtail, but all were good (and fresh).\n\nAfterwards, we had one more sushi item: the foie gras sushi.  It's really difficult to describe the taste of foie gras; it is distinct, but not overwhelming.  It was delicious, and making sushi out of it is an interesting concept.\n\nFor our last dish, we had the cook make us something of his choice.  He personally brought it to the table, and explained what it was.  He made us avocado tempura wrapped in see eel, with foie gras on top.  As if the meal wasn't already awesome enough, this totally elevated it to a new level.  It may make me a snob, but there's nothing I like more than having a piece of art made just for me, and having the artist personally unravel it.  If you have any appreciation of cuisine as an art form, this is clearly the place for you.\n\nWe finished our meal with the UFO dessert, which is a disc-shaped pastry stuffed with red bean and battered in tempura, and topped with ice cream.  It was pretty good.\n\nNow, I have had some pretty good meals in my life, but if I were look back and consider which one was the very best, this one would definitely merit consideration.  It may not appeal to the fan of generic sushi rolls, but if you like trying new and interesting things, you're sure to find some potential here.  The quality of the food and of the menu is second to none, as far as sushi restaurants are concerned.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KBG28p3lGX17hOPoHhq5PQ"}

My husband and I go regularly, always seem to get a good table in the bar, and have a drink and a meal each for under $30 total.  There is a $7 happy hour menu including sliders and ribs, but I always get just the steamed broccoli ($3) and couscous ($3) with a glass of the Bogle pinor noir ($6 at happy hour).  Seriously, the couscous could possibly be the best thing on the planet.  Big, yummy cous cous grains with pistachios, raisins and just enough dressing to make it tasty but relatively light.  This is not fluffy cous cous, but a cous cous salad. The ahi is wonderful, the steaks are delish, and the chicken sandwich is yummy too.  They do a nice brunch too, and did a fantastic job for my post-wedding brunch for 30.  The patio is NOT air conditioned however, so keep that in mind if you're planning on dining there in the summer (or on a particularly HOT morning in early May).

There are definitely a lot of notable food places in Las Vegas, but there are just as many bad ones and many of them (good or bad) are overpriced.  At the end of the day, I just want to go somewhere that has good service and serves okay food (that is reasonably priced and hasn't been sitting around for too long).  I think Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill fits the bill (at least at lunchtime).\n\nI had already had one lunch, but I was meeting up with friends and, well, the restaurant is not a park bench so I felt obligated to order something.  I went with the heirloom tomato salad that came with mozzarella, micro greens, pesto, basil aioli, red onion, and a vinaigrette.  The salad was very fresh.  I've had better mozzarella, but the plump heirloom tomatoes were good.  The salad may have been slightly over-garnished and it was a little too tart and powerful due to the vinaigrette and some very strong red onions.\n\nService was very good.  The waiter was friendly, polite and attentive.  He also seemed very apt at judging the pace of the crowd, which is definitely a strong asset in Vegas since some groups want to get-it-and-go while other groups like to stay for a while and decompress.\n\nThe space was fine (contemporary and not cluttered).  It felt like a fresh and clean cafe.  It was open to the casino (actually located in the center of the MGM Grand casino floor).  The casino was not that busy, but I wonder how nice it would be to eat at this place when the casino is busy because I imagine that the smoking nearby would be a problem (kind of like restaurants in some states that have non-smoking and smoking sections right next to each other).\n\nThe portions were big enough.  In other cities, the prices would be a little high for the food being served.  But for Vegas, the prices seemed reasonable.\n\nI would say that Wolfgang Puck would top a lot of the generic 24-hour Vegas Strip casino cafes.  Wolfgang Puck is slightly more expensive than those at lunchtime, but they have enough variety on their menu where you can order some less expensive things if you are trying to keep to a tighter budget.  Because of that, Wolfgang Puck is an okay Las Vegas lunch option if you are looking for fresh and decent food (and not simply something to hold you over until your next meal).", "type": "review", "business_id": "BW1JCE3Qj4uIokg7kLUL7w"}

They don't inform you of the extra charges or if they do something to benefit you, ITS A SURPRISE AND EVERYONE LOVES SURPRISES WHEN THEY GO OUT TO EAT FROM A RESTAURANT RIGHT???\n\nSo one last example, they offer a burrito called enchilada style, which means they put sauce and cheese on the outside.  The burrito is $7.00 but for the scoop of sauce and a little cheese, you guessed it, $2.00 extra and then if you want rice, beans and chips with your burrito, another $2.00 bringing the total to $11.00.....Again $1.00 over the NOTHING OVER $10.00 quote on the receipt.  \n\nLastly about the Fajita plate, $11.00 is apparently without meat, if you want meat, anther $2.00 and the beans offered on the side, another $2.00, that is a $15.00 plate and in any other restaurant, the price would be the same but would include rice, chips and ALL THE TORTILLA's you desire at NO EXTRA CHARGE.\n\nThis is Vegas folks, there are a LOT better Mexican Restaurants in town for the same price of a $13.00 to $15.00 plate with NO HIDDEN CHARGES, better drinks, and just as good Happy Hour Specials.\n\nThe ONLY SAVING grace this place has and this is why they will survive in this town David, is that they are close to UNLV so people who don't have cars can indulge, they are not far from the strip and they do have a LOT OF TVs for watching sports and most people don't need more then a few drinks and some chips to munch on while watching a game.  Just make sure you enjoy the chips dry as the VERY SMALL dish of salsa is NOWHERE NEAR enough for the amount of chips you get and YOU WILL GET CHARGED if you ask for MORE....\n\nThere are better places to watch sports in this town as well.   Read through the reviews, the 4 stars are from people who enjoy cheap, low alcohol drinks who think they are getting a deal.  Read Ms Fabulous W from 5/15/2011, you will really see what your Happy Hour Drink are getting you....LOL\n\nMaybe Glen Learner the Heavy Hitter would like to get his hands on this receipt.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ejS_lQteyzG6PR4gxZN-FQ"}

There are lots of Japanese and Korean dish choices on the menu besides the BBQ. This restaurant DOES HAVE the grills at the tables. \n\nThe BBQ does come with the many side dishes are expected, cucumber salad, kimchi etc. The food also came in a good amount of time. We ordered bulgogi (thinly sliced beef), pork belly, chicken, and a few other beef dishes to cook on the grill. We also ordered a spicy soup and the seafood pancake. I definitely recommend the seafood pancake--it's a huge potato and seafood hash brown sort of dish, very delicious. The portions for the BBQ are huge, so don't worry about under-ordering. They also offer sushi here. While I have never had their sushi, if it's anything like their Korean BBQ than it must be great.\n\nThe environment is a bit more than casual, but not the fanciest place you will ever go. It is kind of loud because the food is cooking right in front of you. I am not sure I would recommend taking your young children here, as mentioned before, the grills ARE at the table and they are open faced. \n\nAs for price, this was a bit more expensive than what I was hoping to pay. In my party of six people, we ended up each paying $25, but that's considering we ordered at least five or six dishes. Still, individually I believe the dish was on average about $10.\n\nThe service is pretty ok. Most of the waiters and waitresses seem to speak English as a second language, but they do know what they're doing. Just make sure you're clear.\n\nOverall, this is a good place to go, as the food is very delicious and satisfying. For a smaller budget, this is a bit of a splurge, but one that's not a bad investment.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ou21lwEBBlUNG3JRAFWFAA"}

We've tried more than half of the menu items and never had a bad meal.  We go after he gets out of work so their happy hour specials are still available (50% off appetizers.)  Even if we're a couple of minutes late they still ALWAYS give us the happy hour discount, just ask!  We usually split a few appetizers and share a bread pudding dessert which is more than enough for dinner.\n\nAlthough I have many favorites, if I was forced to only recommend one item off the menu it would be the braised rib sliders!  They are absolutely fantastic; the meat is extremely tender and flavorful.  I wish they would make an entr\u00e9e sized portion of the sliders (HINT HINT!)  The bread pudding is also to die for.

Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamie's parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce.\n\nThe shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut \"Rumbi rice\".\n\nWe also ordered some of their Bahama Mama's Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something.\n\nFor dessert, we had some of Rumbi's Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling.\n\nAll in all? Great place with reasonable prices, given their generous portions.

Not as good as some of the more pricey buffets but for a $9.99 lunch it beats the $35 buffets anyday. Make sure to get a player card for a better price.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KIn7cdF9NCjhYF6SfFFUVQ"}

Basic Chinese cuisines such as Dim Sum dishes and prettied up traditional dishes stopped there.  You are better off at Panda Express or better yet the frozen section of your grocery store.  However, the food is not the worst of it, the bill came out to $1800 for 8 people...this was my most embarrassing business dinner of my career.\n\n6/30/07 - Recently revisited due to a business dinner.  We were invited  for a client dinner for a group of 20.  The service and decor remains impeccable, but it still leaves me short with the poor quality of food.  I was still very disappointed in even the most basic of dishes.  The only unfortunate positive is that I did not have to pick up the tab, Lilly would have Shanghai me for the second time.  With so many choice not in LV alone, but in the Mandalay Bay, SL would be the last place I would consider.  One thing for sure, it LV price, LV glitz and glamour, and just like LV; you would always leave a little empty, hollowed, shallow, and perhaps slighted.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ECbznso003XMWuS5jfClyw"}

All three were good.\n\nThe pizza hot table featured about nine different varieties at a time, with a new one coming out perhaps once every couple of minutes, as the place was already busy near 11 AM.  Toppings included Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, bacon, mushrooms, olives, Bell Peppers, Jalepe\u00f1o Peppers, pineapple, onions, Canadian Bacon, & so on, baked onto freshly kneaded (not frozen) dough disks of various thicknesses.\n\nI enjoyed comfortable booth seating & the noise level was well tamed for this type of restaurant.\n\nNo, this isn't exactly Gilbert's terrific BoomBozz, my favorite all-you-can-eat pizza place in the whole Valley, but it's also less expensive & I think this Peter Piper really holds its own as a fun place to have lunch now and then.  Of course the biggie is...  It's a BUFFET!!     :-))\n\n$5.49/$4.49 with coupon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jYFhL2RomSSUiRJYWT3mew"}

The Sofia..it had Scamorza (Smoked Mozzarella),Parma Prosciutto,Parmigiano Reggiano ($13). It was ooh soo tasty. We could not eat the whole thing...there was like 3 pieces that we ended up having boxed up.\n\nThen we had dessert.....I am still in heaven just thinking about this dessert. It was the Dolce Della Casa...Slightly Charred Sweet Calzone\nfilled with Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce and Banana topped with Vanilla Ice Cream...OOOOOhhh my God.

You save a whopping 55 cents by ordering half.  Now I know there's labor to make the sandwich, but the prices tell me the ingredients are worth $1.10.

In a restaurant you should have the ability to choose what you want to eat, not have them altered by lack of supplies. Personally The service was \"OK\" at best, but the main killer was the quality of the food. I found various burnt chunks of Chow Mien on my plate. Also when served orange chicken (my favorite) the lady gave me less than 1/4 a scoop and piled the crap out of my plate with fish (which lacked any sauce making it way to fishy) Where I live there is a Panda about 1/4 the size of that restaurant that knocks it out of the park every time.

BOOOO!!!\n\nI called in and made an 8pm reservation for 3 people. My daughter and I were meeting my husband up there, we were in separate cars so the arrival was going to be staggered by approx. 10 minutes. I checked us in for our reservation at 7:48pm at the hostess stand and the hostess said they would seat us when my husband arrived. My 3yr old daughter and I had to wait outside. This was no big deal as we were about 10 minutes early anyways. I did however express that I would like to put in my daughters order asap so the sooner they could seat us, even if my husband had not yet arrived, the better. She needed to eat and I would have liked a starter and a drink while we waited for my husband to join us. Any how, we waited until he arrived at 8:00pm and I was given a choice of two four top tables, one was upstairs and one was down stairs. I chose the upstairs table for convenience as I have a little one and it was a bit quieter up there.\n\nThey sat us at our table, gave us our menus and left us to choose our starters, drinks etc.... Who I thought was the waitress, thinking my order was going to be taken, ends up being the hostess who returns about 5 minutes later and proceeds to ask us to move to a 2 top that is right next to the table we had been seated at. As there is 3 of us I was a bit confused, she said there had been a goof up and that the table we were seated at was reserved for a party of 4 that had not yet arrived but would be coming in in the next 10 minutes. I'm pretty taken back by the situation as I had an 8pm reservation for 3 people and was already seated. She then started saying that I only had a reservation for 2. I  asked her to check the reservation book as it should clearly show that I called and made a reservation for 3 at 8 pm. She said rudely that I had done some sort of  web check in for 2 and never even went down to check the reservation book. \n\nAt this point I'm just baffled at how someone could be arguing with me about something like this as they had already seated us and did not seem to have this issue when I arrived or when they seated us. So she is still asking us to move to a 2 top when we are still clearly 3 of us. Then she says we would have to wait for another table unless we moved to the 2 top. I then asked her again if she would go back and check the reservation book. At this point I was still willing to over look the weird situation at hand but was not willing to be moved to a less than accommodating table. The other hostess then returns and goes thru the whole thing all over again making us feel just awful, my head was spinning and the situation became awkward and even more so uncomfortable. Finally after the rude, disrespectful and aggressive treatment I asked the young lady if she would like us to leave so the other party could be seated when they arrived. I think she finally realized how nonsensical they were being and snidely said no that's OK, but I hope you enjoy your dinner and huffed off. \n\nMy husband and I had had it and decided to leave. No restaurant has that great of  food that any one should ever just accept this kind of treatment. I looked around and there were a few other empty 4 top tables that we could have either been moved to or that they could have placed the other \"non present\" party at. No matter how good the food might have been, the meal we never got to order was already ruined. We have heard mixed reviews regarding the food here but wanted to give it a try any ways. Bad Idea.\n\nWe live in the area and regularly frequent many of the restaurants in the neighborhood and have never, I mean never been treated with such disrespect and horrible unforgivable customer service. I can not even begin to describe how disrespected and demoralized we felt. So on our way out we let the manager know that we would not be staying and that they could take their table and give it to whom ever they wished.\n\nWe were walking to our car and this lady is chasing after us trying to apologizing for the mishap. We were clearly really upset and unhappy with this awful situation. I told her that it was a little too little too late and I let her know we did not wish to have a conversation regarding the situation. She insisted that we talk with her and she would not stop trying to speak with my husband, I finally had to ask her to leave us alone. I mean really, we are not happy, we left and are completely disgusted at what had occurred and she continues to ramble on like it is going to change what had just taken place.\n\nAll I can say is what happened to customer service?? And just because a restaurant is busy at the moment and appears to be doing well it does not mean that their employees can treat their patrons with such blatant disrespect. I have seen a lot of restaurants come and go over the years around here, some have had really good food, some not, but not at any time have we ever encountered this kind of treatment.\n\nWe will not be returning here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uKSX1n1RoAzGq4bV8GPHVg"}

Food is definitely greasy, but as I've said before, foods that are served buffet-style tend to have added fat to keep them from burning sitting on/under heat lamps for hours.  [At least that's what Shirley, former owner/cook of Lumpia Factory, told me.  Shirley, if you're reading this, please open up another restaurant!  Shirley shied away from using the buffet line (only used it on weekend breakfast buffets) and would cook meals to order.]\n\nHad dinner here tonight (12/2/8) after having had a bit of kalamaria at Zorba's Greek Cafe (not Zorba's Adult shop! LOL) down the street.  Had an idea to supplement the squid protein by getting some veggies from JB, but the buffet spread leaned heavily towards meat dishes with little or no veggies or (food allergy) shrimp entrees with lots of veggies.  :(  Still, $5.45 (that's already including tax!) for a two-entree combo with two 1/2 cup scoops of rice is nothing to sneeze at, so I had a plate of chicken apritada (stir-fried on-the-bone chicken with potato wedges, red bell peppers, onions, and carrots in a tomato-based sauce) and pork giniling (stir-fried ground pork with peas, green bell peppers, and onions).  As you might imagine, with the addition of red bell pepper, carrots, and peas, both entree choices were on the sweet side, which is alright, but the dish quickly bored my tastebuds due to lack of other flavor components (unlike Thai cuisine, where every bite offers a spicy, sweet, sour, and salty components to the mix!).  Even the adobo I sampled (sampling is encouraged here) was sweet.\n\n\nOne definitely should try the lunch combos, when they're the freshest, or order the noodle dishes when they're available (usually from lunch to early afternoon).  I've never had the chance to try these noodle dishes [mamis, pancit (canton, malabon, and palabok] since I either partook of the lunch specials or I visited around dinner-time when these said items were no longer offered.  \n\nThe halo-halo especial served here is pretty tasty!  Try the one with ube ice cream (another option, at least then, was mango- Philippine mango ice cream tastes just like Philippine mango, unlike mango flavors I've tried here in the States, where they do not actually TASTE like mango, but only taste like they SMELL- totally two different sensations.)  If you've never had halo-halo before, but have tried the Vietnamese version Che bau mau, then you kind of have an idea of the Pinoy version of it.  Ours, however, has NUMEROUS variations due to additional ingredients, such as leche flan (custard), ube halaya (a pudding, of sorts, made from ground purple yam cooked with coconut milk, butter, and sugar), coconut sport strings, jackfruit, tapioca pearls (boba to you!), and, well, you get the picture.  \"Halo-halo especial\" usually means ice cream is involved.  \n\nJeepney Bistro is where I refer Filipinos and non-Filipinos to eat out of the handful of Chandler establishments the valley has to offer.

I specifically ask that they do not use any other color besides pink(dark and light), white and black because that's our theme, i even called to make sure because it was not written in our order but they still put leaves (green) on the flowers. If you look at the photo I posted here, right in the middle there was a mistake in the pink piping which makes you think \"how come they did not clean or fix it?!\" It was right in the middle!

But the worst part is the hand writing, I even complain about that and they said we could re-write it if you want  because different decorator has different handwriting, so I said ok, so we waited and when she showed it to us it was almost the same as the 1st one just a very tiny difference :( when ordering cakes in a famous bakery vs Smiths' or Albertson you have this very high expectations that they would be able to make the hand writing message in a very professional and very nice one. It did not stand out! They should make the writing bigger and bolder! And when we ordered, the rep couldn't even show us sample pictures so we could have an idea what the cake would look like, she showed us pics from the website (which we already saw) If we only knew that our cake will turn out this way we should have just ordered it in Smiths it would be a lot cheaper and we wouldn't have expected a lot!

We left there feeling like it was one of the best meals we had ever experienced.\n\nFirst, ask for John to be your waiter. As good as the meal was, John put it over the top. He took time to explain multiple dishes to us, and he went out of his way to make our night very special. My wife even hugged him after dinner, he was that good. Thanks John!\n\nMy wife had a basic meal of fillet and baked potato. Both were amazing. The steak was as soft as butter. I had the featured bone-in fillet that had cheese crusted on the top and a balsamic reduction below - amazing! I also took John's recommendation of the gnocchi as a side dish. It had a delicious creamy sauce and shaved truffles on top - awesome!\n\nTo top it off, John brought us a slice of 20? layer chocolate cake for dessert (complimentary). It was on a beautiful plate that had \"Happy 30th Anniversary\" painted in chocolate. It also had a scoop of vanilla gelato. We were stuffed, but we ate about 2/3 of it. It was a delicious end to our meal.\n\nWe have been to lots of very fine steak houses. I would put this up against any of them.

Worth pre-planning to get your shwarma fix.\n\nOrdered takeout, staff was friendly, chatty, and quick.\nShwarma combo plate with salad, hommos, and falafel ($15) was two meals, and priced well when you consider that adding on the falafel is only a dollar more for 5 pieces- a la carte pricing is 2/$1. Falafel plate with hommos and salad ($10) is also an ample portion, and each plate comes with their own fresh, warm pita.\n\nShwarma is turkey, per the menu notes, but sliced and grilled fresh with good flavor. Falafel is crisp, hommos is creamy and topped with olive oil and parsley, and the salad is legit: fresh lettuce and cabbage, topped with tiny-chopped tomato, onion, and cucumber, and doused with a good amount of tahini dressing.There's no feta, but that probably carries over from the kosher dishes. I added some myself at home for extra oomph!\n\nThey also have burekas- small square pastries stuffed with potato, spinach, or mushroom; the latter is my favorite, highly recommend.\n\nSide tangent: Not sure why this place hypes up falafel as healthy.

Yes, we don't have kids ourselves, but come in the name of solidarity and making all the kids jealous of our game playing skills and fat ticket stacks or so we thought. There are few places to do kids birthday parties and I'm sure kids were having a great time, but I laughed at some of the glazed looks on some parents eyes.\n\nThey tried to make it better by offering lite beer and generic wine, but I guess some Summahood parents went buck wild as there is a one per hour limit on alcohol per person. I don't think you can even get a buzz from that even if you used that watered down crap as a alcohol enema. I don't know what changed with pizza, but it was much better even in the past  years when I've been to birthdays for my nephews here and certainly it was way better when I was a child. Now it taste much more frozen, premade crust. Did not try anything else like wings on the menu and there is a small salad bar which is maybe your best bet honestly. \n\nNow the BF and I walked around in hopes to find some games to play. Together because you can't leave a mustached tall white man alone without paranoid parents pulling their kids away I make the boyfriend slightly less molest-y. Fuck your ugly little ginger kid, sir. \n\nThere were a lot of games that were like throw your coin in and leave it up to chance type games. Basically, slot machines for babies and equally as rage inducing and disappointing, but compels you to put more coins in. One even was a complete racket. I put a coin in, got it where it should to score some tickets then it told me I got a  \"bonus\" ticket frenzy type thing, but only if I throw another coin in. Stick to playing interactive games like the basketball, football toss and skeeball. Don't go on the spinning game/ride thing. It smells like pee pee. The best game we found was a Deal or No Deal thing as it had long play value and the BF somehow picks the suitcase with the max amount of tickets so it's one of the few that pays out.  I know I didn't get less shitty on games as I got older, so they must have become tighter on tickets as I had a tiny pile. I have in a storage box a few dolls I won at Chuck E Cheese circa the 90's so the prizes definitely aren't as great either as everything was looking much more low quality. The playground is one area to climb up and go into 2 tubes to 2 hidey holes and a slide - that's it. I guess it can't be TOO fun because they need you to play some games. \n\nIf you do go, look online for coupons. There's almost always a $20 for 100 tokens and some food coupons (though I advise to get pizza instead across the street before/after instead) . \n\nThe plus for me is the random video montages, music videos and slightly creepy sensual song choices of the animatronic singing Chuck E. I was singing the parody of the Michael Jackson song they did \"I wanna Barbeque\" all night from this music video of some purple Grimace/ Barney/Chef lovechild thing in a glittery ass suit. Probably highlight of entertainment is musical adults discussing merits of these little jingles. And what is up with the Zach Galifianakis look alike with a wolf painted face hanging out on a beach during sunset video clip?\n\nMaybe showed up a bit too sober, but definitely learned if there is a next time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kSSvuD81S7T1Nrr2qsXVPQ"}

Seems the atmosphere of dress wear was also mixed but coming here somewhat dressy is also the preferred method of partying. But again, there is mix of both dressy and casual dressing throughout the evening on both my visits here.\n\nEverywhere is pretty dark. Seating is usually reserved or if you got the bottle service, so if you come here early...like 11pm, then maybe you might get some seating. Otherwise it's pretty much standing room only everywhere you go. The urinal is cool but awkward since there is view of the outside from the 64th floor but at the same time, you're looking directly ahead at another set of urinals from across the hotel so there is a good chance you're making eye contact with a dude pissing at the same time.\n\nPretty awesome views, the people aren't trashy or anything, seems more sophisticated, varying music throughout the night and plenty of security everywhere. Yah, this place is cool.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Pz7SWZQhxL6ZbhL9jE2NTA"}

As I mentioned, it was pretty quiet. I had wanted to dance but there was no one the dance floor - and I hadn't had nearly enough to shake my booty solo. \n\nHubs treated to some sparkling and we just chilled and enjoyed the view at a lounge table.

I went in with my parents, and we were blown away by the meal and the service we got.   Sebastian, the manager, was terrific.  Bianca, our server, was as good as it gets.\n\nBefore people say that we were treated well simply because of a negative review, I will say that I was actually watching the tables around us, and I have to say that everybody seemed to be getting great service!\n\nNow the food-honestly, it was like I was in a different restaurant.  We started with Shrimp cocktail.  This was served in a pretty unique way, more of a small salad with shrimp mixed into it.  At the bottom of the bowl was a horseradish custard.  The dish was outstanding.  My father got a plate of sliced meats of different type (I forgot what it's called) and he loved it.\n\nBecause I was unhappy with the Tuna I had for an app last time, we were brought out a portion to try.  Once again, it was like a different dish.  The tuna had a great spice to it, and the veggies underneath were very crisp.  THAT\"S what tuna tartare should be like!  It was great.\n\nWe also had the Gnocchi appetizer.  Once again-it was outstanding.  Terrific mushrooms, Gnocchi, and vegetables, cooked and seasoned perfectly.  It was delicious.\n\nFor mains, we got the Surf and turf (Chicken breast, with lobster), the Bison fillet, and a beef filet.  SImply put, each dish was amazing.  The Bison was so tender you could almost cut it just with a fork.  My dad got the Beef filet, and the fork mashed potatoes.  As soon as the waitress put the potatoes in front of him, I said \"Dad, that looks like a different dish than the potatoes I got last time\". And I was right, because these had seasoning, butter, and were delicious! Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.\n\nFor desert, we had vanilla bean ice cream, the cheesecake, and a \"Deconstructed apple pie\".  We loved every bite.\n\nI've come to realize that any restaurant can have a bad night.  The food and service on the second trip MORE than made up for it.  I will say, I was shocked to hear from the manager after the first visit.  The effort he put in to track me down and be sure we had a great experience was incredible-there should be more restaurant managers like Sebastian here in Vegas.\n\nNot only will I be back again (as will my parents), but we've already relayed this story to several of our friends who are going to be trying MIX.\n\nThank You!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Pz7SWZQhxL6ZbhL9jE2NTA"}

The free opera on the lake had us more intrigued, but the live music had us make a return after the opera performance.  This place was popping, mostly because a wedding party was celebrating their after party there.  \n\nThe band playing was giving up some pretty cool tunes, and we soon found out why.  They were were Acoustic Soul, \"...the first, fully live, by-request acoustic rock band in Vegas\" as noted on their myspace page.  And they were pretty good.  The BF and I got a drink at the bar ($5.50 for a pint) and settled in to listen to them play various songs from Johnny Cash to Britney Spears to John Mayer to Eric Clapton.  They were good and everyone was loving them.\n\nWe can't say too much about The Auld Dubliner except that they offer outdoor seating, which can be great on certain nights.  And they do serve up Magners Cider for us non-beer drinkers.  You can also find food here for lunch and dinner.

Yes a bit pricey for what it is, but still a quality meal. Going back to the first visit my wife ordered the Calamari with pasta and for her it was one of the best dishes she has ever had and she isn't a real seafood lover, $32 but worth it. Today she had the pasta and scallops, but when I tired one of her scallops it was a bit too salty for my taste, but my wife didn't mind. Then I know it boring, but I like plain ole spaghetti and meatballs and it isn't on the menu. Today I did have the linguini and meatballs and it was good. I did have some odd shaped fork that was kind of round and short for some reason and it made pasta eating a chore. Overall a good place and good service, BUT the service isn't perfect. Waitresses are effective but not perfect. I wasn't offered any parmesean cheese at all, but I didn't really care one way or the other, but it should be offered. After the meal the tired looking dessert tray was presented, but no item per item description of what was being offered, just \"would you like some dessert?\" Overall it's quality food and wonderful homemade pasta. We'll be back to try the Calamari entree for my wife if it's available on the specials and I'll have whatever is close to spaghetti. Oh yes, we've never seen the owner or chef come out to the table.

The marinara sauce is the only thing to find fault. Tomato sauce you could safely serve your entire family without complaint for too much salt, pepper, oregano, or spice. A flavourless endeavour. Overall my impression was that the chef has lost his passion for food and is phoning it in. Uninspired average fare. \n\nPricing is where I have issue. Two people with one drink each came out to $30 per person. For what it was, its overpriced. $20 per person is appropriate.\n\nWould I eat here again?

I really have absolutely no problem with this policy, but I could see how it would piss some people off -- maybe from an older generation who feel slighted by shit like this, which is why I'm even discussing it.

The edamame came out cold, which was okay, as it is typically served cooled .. but I actually prefer my edamame heated and the server never asked for a preference ... hell, they even ask you at throw-away joints like Ra.  Since we are a culture of benevolent Americans who are intent on skewing EVERY foreign dish, I always assume that the edamame will be served warm.  Either way, I was too timid to ask since these servers seem to be flying around the small restaurant with nary a second to spare at the microwave.  The miso soup was excellent ... but if I'm looking for shit to complain about, they served it with that damn goofy, oversized spoon.\n\nWhen we got our boat of fish my gf and I commented that we would have liked a little extra prep time.  I mean come on, there needs to be distinct transitional times between courses.  We were only mildly impressed with the presentation.  The rolls were prepped very sloppily.  The yellowtail was absolutely lost in the rice.  The tempura shrimp was sliced so thin that it was destroyed by the chopstick.  The caterpillar roll had almost no essence of eel within.  The spicy tuna was good, but nothing to rave about as seems to be the trend when discussing Hana.  We also ordered the processed daikon off of their specials-board [which our server never went over BTW], and I would highly recommend staying away from this unless you curiously want to know what Little Lisa's Slurry from the Simpson's episode \"The Old Man and The Lisa\" might have tasted like.  Blech.  I'm sure it was downhome authentic, but Christ, THAT was vile.  Anyway, that was MY fault, not Hana's.\n\nI will say that the first time that I came to Hana [with Graham C and Yelp's famous Jerry], it was absolutely phenomenal.  I think something has been lost in translation.  Back then, their rolls were much better prepared and the toro was otherworldly.  Perhaps it is the hulking Melrose virulence seeping into their foundation.\n\nI will conclude with a statement about  how I am aware that Hana is going for authenticity; which makes the curt service, lack of formalities like \"hi! how is everyone today\" [I doubt they do that shit at sushi joints in Japan], and loud, bustling atmosphere work to a degree.  I can HOWEVER, see that being such a turn-off to those unwilling or unaware to put up with it, or worse yet, interpret it as rudeness.  I personally like the fact that places like Hana exist as an antithesis to garbage like Ra.  But every polarization needs an equilibrium, and for my money, time, and need for experience, nothing beats Sakana.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h6jfMpTZpNduLG0wE2tbaw"}

The only thing they could possibly do better is have some more reasonably priced drink selections. The food was wowza, off the charts. We started with a 3 cheese tray that consisted of Fontina, Parmesan and something else... it comes with honey, spicy apricots and brandied cherries. (No, they won't let you drink the brandy out of the jar, damnit!) Cheese was awesome. I don't think we even touched the bread, once the cheese came out. I don't know about all the bread complaints. Despite the fact that it had a very dark, well-done crust, I think it's a stretch to call it burned. Probably think your glass is half-empty if you call the bread burned. I had some sort of pizza. It was on the back of their menu, where they have their pasta and pizza of-the-day selection, below the cheeses. Other person in my party had the carbonara. My pizza had some sort of ham-thickness meat, arugula and tepanade. It was an thin crust pizza, that was more than large enough for one person. I wasn't too hot on the carbonara, but it was still quite good. I'd probably try other items, myself. I didn't like the fact that they have small, expensive wine pours. Their wine list's cheapest bottle is $32, average around $90, up to $400. Ok, I don't have a problem buying a $32 bottle of wine. But if I buy the cheapest bottle, I look like the cheapest patron. Anyway, I'd appreciate cheaper drinks. Other than the goofy wine list, I found it to be just awesome. In fact, I plan on visiting again. Maybe they can start charging a corkage fee for my 40 oz'rs.

That's David Burke, and I got to taste this losers food first-hand with the restaurant bearing his name, and I'd have to break it down Iron Chef style:\n\nLike the original Iron Chef, each chef can be awarded up to 20 points; \n-- consisting of up to 10 points for taste\n-- up to 5 points for plating (the appearance of their presentation)\n-- and up to 5 points for the originality of their dishes.\n\nSince it was New Years Eve, we did the prix fixe menu which consisted of either the 5 course ($125.00) or the 4 course meal ($95.00). \n\nTASTE:\n----------------------------------------------\nAside from the amuse-bouche, we were also served a brioche with butter served atop a brick of Himalayan pink salt (odd, but I received this also as an Xmas gift). This wasn't that impressive in regards to flavor, so was this mainly about novelty/plating vs. taste? If this was served atop Elvis collectible plates, it would have won a couple more points for originality.\n\nThis is what pissed me off the most, and I think it's what made me despise this place to some degree. It's that they served up the main dish as a \"Kobe beef\" dish which I really questioned at the get-go because most of the times it's not \"Kobe\" beef. Kobe is from the Hyogo Prefecture in Japan. Most times, this isn't what you're getting. Instead, what you get, including the place I worked at is wagyu beef, but it's usually Australian or American wagyu. We got American wagyu which is what Jay, one of our servers had stipulated to us, and if this confuses you, you can liken the naming of Kobe, like Champagne which should be called \"bubbly\" or hot tubs being called a \"Jacuzzi\". So, regardless what it's called, it sucked! It was no where near the quality or taste of Australian or Japanese wagyu. What I ate didn't taste like, and had nowhere near the marbling of the wagyu you can pick-up at Mitsuwa for some freak'n chump change ($59.99 a lb). If they would have just called it American Wagyu, than my expectations would have been lower and more appropriate, but of course it's all about the easily marketable recognition of \"Kobe beef\". Another sidenote: The \"Himalayan salt\" is actually also marketing mumbo jumbo because it's actually a product primarily from Pakistan.\n\nI already went off on the Kobe beef being called \"Kobe\", but I never mentioned how it was also prepared overly salted!!, and I'm a huge salt-a-holic. This one was almost so bad that we should have sent it back because they also didn't bother to trim the meat properly, so I had a decent portion of my cut that was a huge chunk of fat. Yum, I got to eat huge chunks of salty fat.... I hope it was Pakistani salt.\n\nThe biggest redemption to the meal was definitely the fish dish. The roasted red pepper puree and the dish as a whole was very good, and I think everybody enjoyed this one the most. \n\nThe last bit of the meal to top things off was the dessert. I'm not a huge sweets/dessert fan, but I made an exception for this dessert because I can't pass up chocolate if I do eat sweets, and the crunchy texture of the dessert was probably one of the most impressive elements of the dessert. I should also say that the scoop of ice cream wasn't chocolate. Instead, It was some funky flavor. An Iron Chef trademark.\n\nPLATING:\n----------------------------------------------\nThe butter we had for the brioche was plated atop a brick of Himalayan salt that's pink in color, so it looked kind of cool, but I just thought it was such a waste if they didn't re-use the salt although I'm sure they do since salt is inherently antimicrobial.\n\nWhat I did enjoy was the multiple vegetable puree's that were served with the dishes including the multitude of small little veggies involved in the plating. A lot of detail, and a lot of effort were put into these dishes that were tasty and looked good. Also, they used culinary foam...ooh, aahh.\n\nORIGINALITY:\n----------------------------------------------\nThe beginning of the meal started with the amuse-bouche which is supposed to be a hint at the what's to come, but what was presented was an extremely unoriginal and extremely typical tuna tartare. After seeing that, I wasn't too optimistic on originality. I think this would be common place even in a mid-west suburban franchise.\n\nThe next unoriginal dish was the spinach salad with some sort or balsamic vinaigrette which possibly consisted of some gorgonzola cheese, apple slices, and candied walnuts. This was a huge f'n let down because it was so typical. I've even prepared this sort of salad numerous times, but I include sliced red onions for my tastes, and I prefer arugula over spinach.\n\nHere's how I judged David Burke's restaurant:\n-- TASTE: 7\n-- PLATING: 3\n-- ORIGINALITY: 2\n\nTOTAL SCORE IS: a 12 out of a 20\n\nThe total bill was $601 for 4 people with an automatic 20% tip, so whose the loser now.... ok, it's not David Burke.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oVfM3YqMRE1Dglf7cmvb2w"}

It was also Labor Day.\n\nWe ordered the following items:\n1 lb. of shrimp\n1 lb. of craw fish\na couple ears of corn each\nSweet potato fries\n\nand we had this in the \"mild\" hot n juicy sauce.\n\nBoy was it NOT mild.  It was super hot!  But it was so good.  The sauce was best paired with the craw fish.  The juice from the shrimp does not take as well, but if you peel the shrimp and then plunge the entire body into the sauce in the bag, then you are good to go with the awesome hot n juicy and very garlicky flavor.

The host was pretty cool and talked to us for a bit while we waited for our table. We finally got seated and ordered right away. It pretty much took them 20 minutes or more for them to come out and let us know that our food was going to be coming out a little late due to the rush they had. 10-15 minutes after that was when our food came out. The sauce was good but a bit watery. The shrimp was perfect and not over cooked. The service was alright with the waiter coming to check on his here and there. As I was eating one of the remaining shrimp that was left in the bag I noticed a thick black hair on the head of the shrimp. Normally I would think it was just the whiskers or whatever you want to call it from the shrimp but NO it was straight up a pubic hair with the little white thing on bottom tip of it from wherever the hair was from. My friend decided to take the piece of shrimp with pube still on it up to the front and complain. The asshole Caucasian male waiter gave her attitude and claimed it wasn't hair and that it was one of the whiskers from the shrimp. He said that the hair wasn't purely black and that there was a redish color to it which was bull shit. So my friend came back to sit down with us and was irritated with the waiter for handling the situation the way he did. The host that was talking to us before we got seated walked by and we showed him the hair and even he himself knew it was a piece of hair. He joked around and said \"well thats obviously not my hair.\" and laughed because he had a buzzed head. He finally took care of the situation and took the order of shrimp off the bill for us and apologized. \n\nOverall... place is over priced compared to what the Cali prices are. The sauce is not too bad but not what I imagined it to be after all the hype.

The last time I had boba I liked was at a Quickly! in the bay almost two years ago. The Lollicup near my house, which was promoting itself as if it's shit didn't stink but had weird, unpredictable hours and always managed to be \"out\" of boba whenever I was really craving it. So Pho Avina it was.\n\nOrdering was only a minor travesty. The restaurant is so tiny and compact that the only place to put their register/takeout counter is right next to the path of the servers, so in the couple of minutes it took us to place our order we managed to obstruct every other employee working there. Thankfully, despite the complaints of my fellow yelper girls, I wear heels about 90 percent of the time, which makes me I'm easy to spot and never surprise someone turning a corner. If they run into me it's because they're jerks and want to see if I'll say \"excuse me\" and give away my gender. Puny non-yelpers. The mighty Jetta is not fooled by your nonsense.\n\nWe spent the fifteen minute waiting period out and about the strip mall, reading The New Times and visiting the nearby gaming store which I'm going to yelp anyway despite not buying anything. 15 minutes isn't a bad waiting time for egg noodle soup and boba. I've waited longer for a cheezburger and shake. Oh jesus, did I just spell \"cheeseburger\" with a z? I know I should correct it, but I feel compelled to leave it there. the internet has permanently fucked my cognitive language skills. \n\nI ordered the #41 (egg noodle, shrimp, crab, calamari) and a coconut boba. John ordered the old school \"beef and rice noodle\" pho and a taro boba which he could not describe the flavor of and whenever asked how it was or how it tasted kept thrusting it in my face and telling me to try some. The sense of urgency in his voice didn't compel me to want to take that leap.\n\nThe takeout arrangement was both clever, convenient, and troublesome. In our bag were two styrofoam cups of soup, little baggies of warm noodles, and a ziploc of cilantro, sprouts, peppers, and limes. While this made taking our lunch back to the office quick and easy, it did cause some problems in unloading its contents. The noodles, while still warm, were beginning to stick to each other and solidify, which made stuffing it in the cup of broth rather difficult, especially when the noodles didn't separate once submerged. The portions of noodles were relatively small, and I ended up having to put in handfuls of sprouts just to adequately fill the cup, which itself was modest at best. I know I would've gotten more if we had ordered dine-in. \n\nI don't mean to sound like another one of those portion-obsessed Americans, but with work and school and Aramark's price-gouging at our cafeteria, my lunch has to hold me over for the whole day. And this didn't work out for me.\n\nThe food (what little of it was there), was actually quite tasty. The squid was chewy, the crab meat tasted real, and the two shrimp that were in there were pretty massive. The broth was hands down the best part. I could drink a whole bowl of that shit. But won't. Because too much sodium is never fun.\n\nI realized waaaaaay after the fact that what we had ordered was not in fact boba milk tea but in fact \"snow bubble milk tea\" (i.e. frozen boba). The pearls were frozen solid and hard to chew and more than one my straw did the \"McDonald's Choke\" where the contents became so cold they would not submit to the vacuum I was creating. Eventually I just let it sit on my desk for a half hour where it melted and was then delicious.\n\n[Joke about how lesbians aren't as good at sucking things as other people has been omitted.

I faced a lot of disappointments and mediocrity before I found Thai Lahna and crowned it my valley favorite, but while I have enjoyed consistently good Thai at Thai Lahna, I have never gotten that glorious rush from eating their food.  The first time I tried anything from Sala Thai, my girlfriend ordered me Green Curry to go after dining there with her mother.  When she requested it Thai Hot, the server politely giggled behind her hand.  That curry was the single spiciest thing I have ever eaten.  I am accustomed to spice, but the girl took one bite and promptly ate two slices of bread to cool her esophagus.  I don't know if the spice dispenser malfunctioned, or they felt like messing with us or what, but it was basically a little cardboard trapezoid of napalm.  Even then, the delicate, sweet, earthy, volcanic flavors of their green curry came through.  A week or so later I found an excuse to try a visit to Sala in person.  I am often crippled by extensive menus, I find myself agonizing over the whole concept of \"But what if one of my all-time favorite dishes is on this menu, but I choose the wrong thing and never come back, and my life is .003% less satisfying...\", and the Sala Thai menu features pictures that make everything look delicious.  Ultimately I chose to go with Spicy Eggplant, which is out of character for me, because in trying any new Thai restaurant, my two defaults to establish a barometer are Green Curry and Pad Thai.  If you get those right, I trust you to do everything else.  So my Spicy Eggplant hits the table...you know those moments when food looks so spectacular that you're almost embarassed to defile it by eating it?  That was the case here, and not because it used fancy technique or elaborate chef-driven painting with sauces, but because the produce was so fresh, and the balance of colors so gorgeous, it essentially became some sort of accidental, outsider pop art.   Or something.  The important part is that it was exquisitely delicious.  The eggplant's texture was silky as it should be, the balance of sweet, savory, earthy and spicy was perfect, the rice was the proper consistency..it was what I want Thai food to be.  I have not been to Thailand, I have no close friends or relatives of Thai descent, I haven't read an encyclopedia of Thai cooking.  I only know that my mouth and belly left pleased as they have been by no other Thai place in town, and that is good enough for me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WPmamMTGAmNYXGoXW1mWyQ"}

The two of us were gawking over every dish on the menu and actually logged a (faux) complaint to the very nice and knowledgeable waitress that there were too many attractive options on the menu to choose from!\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. Legume is a small (14 tables) restaurant in Regent Square (on S. Braddock Ave.) The interior isn't the most extravagant, but if you can score one of the two tables by the windows (we did!) you'll have a semi-private nook to dine in. The wait staff were all very friendly and did everything they could to make our dining experience exceptional. And boy did they succeed.\n\nBut the decor and service were nothing compared to the food. It was, by far, one of the best (and creative) meals I've had in a while (I just made a trip to NYC). \n\nWe started with a baked cheese, honey, granny smith apples, and sour cherry dish that was divine. Possibly my favorite part of the meal. The cheese had this wonderful texture (think Baked Bree, but with a more solid consistency...but still very soft) and the honey flavor was perfect.\n\nNext we ordered the Duck Confit and belly of some fish (forgot the menu at home) served raw. Both were delicious. The duck was rich (as it should be given that it was cooked in its own fat) and the fish was meaty (in a very good way) and perfectly prepared.\n\nOur main dishes were veal and antelope leg. Yup, you read that right, antelope leg! I've never had it before, but it was fantastic...a cross between duck and beef. And I can't forget the veal...a nice piece that was so tender that it fell apart in your mouth.\n\nAs a side, we had brussel sprouts with bacon! Yum. Though I tend to prefer when the brussel sprouts are still intact in their little balls of deliciousness...this dish came with the leaves separated. Still great though.\n\nWe capped off the meal with a baked apple crisp topped with creme fresh. It was the prefect end to a wonderful meal.\n\nAnd, by the way, this place is BYOB, so you can easily save $30-40 on the wine. \n\nYou can be certain that I will be going back to this delicious eatery again and again!", "type": "review", "business_id": "kc5gJPisT5L5z8lLa9FV9A"}

He passed the blame to the manager which I thought was kind of strange.  He also did not even offer to do an up charge on the whipped cream  You would think they least they could do since there was no nuts, is offer free whipped cream but we were not even asking for that.

There was a lot of miscommunication - here's why:\n\nUpon walking in, we were pleased to see that they still offer all night happy hour on Sundays and Mondays.  (Their happy hour = 1/2 off most appetizers and I believe drink specials too).  The hostess asked us for our name and we responded that we didn't have a  reservation; that we were just going to eat and drink in the bar area. She was not the friendliest, and just nodded.  Side note - no reservation was needed as the restaurant was not busy!\n\nSo, we sat in the bar area and when the waiter came to take our order (we were a group of 4), we placed several appetizer orders right off the bat and said that would be good to start and we'd add more to the order in a bit.  We also ordered drinks.  I specifically ordered my new favorite 'black cherry effen vodka with soda.'\n\nSo when the waiter came back with the news that they were out of black cherry effen and didn't carry it anymore, I was a little disappointed.  No big deal though, I went with the 3 Olives Cherry Vodka instead WITH SODA.  \n\nWaiter comes back with the drinks and mine  looks like cherry coke.  I taste it and sure enough. he's given me a cherry vodka with diet coke - no clue where that came from, but he took it back and brought me (finally) what I ordered.  In the meantime. he came over and asked if we were ready to order... When we asked if the first round would be out soon, he said he didn't put it in yet as he did not think we were serious when we put the first round in.  Ugh - not funny when you're with 2 very hungry men :)\n\nWe ended up ordering more and were all hungry for the first round of scallops, ahi tuna, mixed green/pear/goat cheese salad, corn and crab chowder. and crab cake.  In the meantime, we were given bread and butter, but alas, no silverware, app plates, or napkins... no big deal - we got those within a couple of minutes.  \n\nWe were so happy with the first round. (except for the soup which we all agreed tasted like water and potatoes so we sent it back) that we decided to order more... another scallops. another ahi tuna, a tuna tartare, broiled oysters with a spinach and artichoke fondue, and a steak.  This time, it took an extremely long time for our food to arrive and when it did, the scallops were presented totally different and the ahi was overcooked.  Also, the waiter thought we ordered raw oysters and not the broiled ones...\n\nAt that point, we were done - no need to attempt to correct the order.  The soup and ahi were removed from the bill (as they should've been - we did send them back).  \n\nI have to say, aside from the company, this meal was just mediocre.  I've had great meals at Eddie V's in the past, and hopefully this was just an 'off' evening, but I will not be running back anytime in the near future!\n\nSorry, Eddie V - only 3 stars this time...our meal was a comedy of errors and even with happy hour all night, not worth the $$!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qiwajZigq_2twTmYofPmDQ"}

I asked for the name after dinner as I wanted to see if I could find it in the stores, and our server promptly brought it back written in a Ruth's Chris card.  \n\nBack to the food, we both ordered Ribeye steaks, and also the creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin.

Kevin and I could easily share this steak, but asking us to share a steak is a big no no! :)  We loved it and cannot wait to have the leftovers tonight, truely one of my favorite steaks.  The last three years we have always had it with potatoes au gratin and another side.  So obviously you can tell we love the cheesy gooey'ness of the potatoes, but have not found another side that we love.  Sure the salads and the spinach are good, but we haven't found that second staple - of course that is a good thing so we can try different sides.  The bread is good too - We had 2 slices left and asked them to pack is up for us - instead they packed up a whole new loaf!\n\nAs you can tell, we do not go here often, it is a special treat because of the price.  I love our once a year deal to come here.  Food is great and service has always been fabulous - we are treated so well.  The first time we came here, I had a wine I hated, did not drink much of it and the server commented on it.  Since we were done with our meal, he brought out a sampler of desserts on the house - very kind of them.  Let me say, if we did not have so many desserts at home because of our birthdays, we would have ordered the cheesecake - it is fabulous!\n\nUntil next year Ruth Chris!", "type": "review", "business_id": "UTt11gZCgDL6F9IVyQDejQ"}

I almost bought some to go. Mine also came with a salad on the plate. Not as large as a side salad but just enough to compliment the meal and the italian dressing was really great.

What is a \"fail-bot\", pray tell? Imagine a robot designed with the sole purpose to fail. Who would design such a robot built to never accomplish anything? I can't tell you for sure, but chances are they had a hand in my culinary experience at the Buffet at Treasure Island. \n\nNow let's set some ground expectations. 1.) I'm in a casino on the Vegas Strip, expect to pay through the nose for food and drinks. 2.) Buffet = Food cooked some time ago. 3.) ... I'm bored, let's move on.\n\nThere are certainly a fair share of buffets on the Las Vegas Strip that will cost you between $20-30 for lunch or dinner, they all have food out and heated, and they all come with a wide assortment of regional foods. Lucky for me this particular meal was on my boss because the food was close to appalling (and I enjoy buffets). \n\nThe sushi had been sitting out to the point that the rice was beginning to harden. Asking the sushi station chef for a fresh plate was out of the question as the station was left unattended for the duration of my meal. OK, so sushi buffets are often a sub-par experience to sitting at sushi bar and having a chef slice and roll to your very heart's content, surely there are some other delicious items to sample? The bbq ribs were not bad and neither were the Korean short ribs. The beef brisket was tough and the accompanying bbq sauce resembled something I once dipped a Chicken McNugget into. The Asian food station was likely my greatest disappointment. Simply and seriously put, I have had higher quality food at Panda Express. Enough of the bad? I will say that the service staff was polite and attentive. At the dessert station I was greeted by a very pleasant woman named Olga, who was not only friendly, but recommended the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e which left a sweet note on what was certainly a bitter dining experience.\n\nI will admit that buffets can often be made or broken on timing, however in Las Vegas with the myriad buffets available and the $20+ /person price I was sorely left with my expectations completely unsatisfied. I expect that at that price I'm not only paying for the variety of food, but also paying for someone to keep the food fresh. If you are dead set on a buffet on the Las Vegas Strip, skip  Treasure Island and give Spice Market (Planet Hollywood) or the Buffet at the Bellagio a try. Same price, better variety, and far better food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_xmJB767rROtAy6XepMlkQ"}

The meat was very well cooked, very juicy, along with the slight taste of wasabi, yum!\n+Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll - fresh fish and refreshing taste!\n+Butterfish Tataki - delicious little piece of butterfish with white asparagus and Yuzu, we should've ordered two!\n+Robata Grilled Unagi - the unagi was grilled to the perfection, so soft,  and you can feel it melts in your mouth - heaven!\n+Fried Soft Shell Crab with Mixed Green - the crab was really good, but didn't really like the chili dressing, it tasted kinda sour to me.\n+Rice Hot Pot with Japanese mushrooms - we didn't order this until we saw the waiter brought it to the next table, we were amazed by how the rice was cooked and decided to give a shot (it's on the regular menu). The rice was mixed with four kinds of japanese mushrooms and beans in a light miso broth, very flavorful, but I thought it was a bit too salty (i do eat less salty than majority of my friends)\n\nDrinks:\n+Tanuki Peach, signature cocktail - Shochu with peach puree, sweet and fruity, a great fresh start of the meal\n+Japanese Pomelo Lemonade - this is NOT your typical lemonade from any other restaurants, they're made from the Japanese pomelo juice (a citrus fruit) with lemons, very citrusy, my friend liked it a lot. They waitress told us they imported the juice directly from Japan. And it's $7 per glass, even more expensive than a martini!\n\nI will definitely come back for dinner sometime soon, oh, I also noticed that they have brunch/lunch buffet on Saturday for $35/person, endless sushi and more!", "type": "review", "business_id": "bgTB6MgdVQssXhkNJ7qIfw"}

We opted to try several small dishes over the entrees and every dish was amazing. The sashimi was the freshest I've ever had. I also recommend the butterfish tataki and salmon nigiri. The shishito peppers, sweet potatoes, and corn are excellent vegetable options. \n\nThe service at Roka Akor is phenomenal. The servers are perfectly trained, knowledgeable, and considerate. Several people assist the waiter with delivering dishes, drinks, cleaning, and questions. They all work to ensure that customers have a wonderful experience.\n\nThe prices are a little high, but completely worth it for the quality, service, and ambiance. It's easy to run up a high bill, so I recommend bringing a Groupon-style coupon.\n\nRoka Akor is one of the finest places that I have dined and I highly recommend it to others.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bgTB6MgdVQssXhkNJ7qIfw"}

A few years ago I had one of the best restaurant steaks ever at Delmonico in Palazzo's little-sister hotel the Venetian, so I think it's reasonable to expect even better quality from the higher-end hotel.  Unfortunately, in my case the experience fell well short of my expectations.\n\nWe were seated quickly at around 7pm, at which time the dining room was relatively empty and a large crew of servers stood at the ready.  The room itself is fairly low-key and classy, with interesting art hanging on the otherwise plain walls.  I like the decor, but I wouldn't mind seeing a bit more design effort.  The front part of the restaurant where you come in features what looks like an oyster bar with a dark wood theme, and I wish they had carried that aesthetic throughout the rest of the dining room.  As it stands, you'll spend your evening staring at relatively unadorned light blue and white walls and large view windows facing the Strip.\n\nOur waiter was quite chatty and informative, giving plenty of suggestions and lots of insight into Morels' impressive cheese and oyster menus.  My buddies and I were in fact very satisfied with the cheese and oyster plates that we ended up ordering as appetizers.\n\nMorels also offers an extensive wine list, with a varied selection of wine styles spread across a wide range of price points.  However, one thing that bugged me just a little bit was the nature of their wine service.  Morels keeps a sommelier in their employ, but this person doesn't bring out the wine list to help you make your selection.  Instead, you choose your bottle, and then the sommelier appears with the bottle and pours it for you.  When your glass gets low, he swings by your table and tops you off.  Now I'm all for sommeliers, but wouldn't it be better if he showed up earlier and guided you through the wine list, helping you make a pairing based on the food you order?  I'm a wine novice so I certainly would have appreciated the help.  As I said, not a huge complaint, just kind of odd.\n\nSo onto the entrees, and here is where most of the stars got deducted.  First of all, the food took a while to show up.  Of course, this is pretty typical for a fancy restaurant, but by the time our wait started to feel long, the room hadn't really filled up yet.  That said, I am generally willing to give the kitchen staff the benefit of the doubt.\n\nWhen our sides failed to arrive with our steaks, and none of the many servers carrying the steaks acknowledged that we had even ordered sides, my mild lack of enthusiasm turned to full-on disappointment.  We tried to wait out the 10 or 15 minutes as our sides were hurriedly prepared and brought out; they turned out to be pretty decent.  The steaks, however, were really, really average.  They were cooked to temperature and had nice marbling, but they tasted plain and unseasoned, with hardly a trace of that meaty flavor that a $50 dry-aged steak ought to have.  It was the first time in many Vegas steakhouse trips that I contemplated using the dipping sauces.  To cap off the meal, I ordered my customary espresso for dessert and it turned out pretty poorly; all evidence pointed to old coffee beans.\n\nAll in all, the dining experience was mildly enjoyable, but heavily marred by the deeply unimpressive entree.  For the same price, I've had much, much better experiences (and steaks) at Cut, Mesa, and Delmonico.  Sorry, Morels.", "type": "review", "business_id": "alWTl5MRC4VE2t9W1mNSIQ"}

Personally, I like The Hop House better. It's a place with a Brick-Oven behind the bar and over 20 Drafts, good stuff. If you like tasty beer, then The Hop House should be a stop for you. They have sampler racks that are $5 for 6-3 oz. samples of  your choice or theirs. My Favs there: Dogfish 60 min IPA, Magic Hat #9 and of course, Yuengling :D The bartenders are knowledgeable about the ales and lagers being served, which is nice considering the broad selection available. Darts, a pool table and plenty of big screen TV's are abound. Occasional Live Bands, Happy Hour Specials, Texas Hold'em Night, Free Pizza and other goodies are normal here. The food here is of so-so quality, nothing too grand, even though there is a wood fired oven. I went here recently with a friend that totally hated her dinner, I wish I could recall what she had, but mine was fine(I had $8 Small Buffalo Chicken Pizza,SuPrIsE). I can't decide if they are slightly over-priced or if their portions are  too small (-1). I mean, you expect to pay more at a place like this, right?\n It seemed like The Idlewood was more of a Workingman's-T-Shirt and Jeans kinda place when I stopped the few times before, whereas it's definitely an office crowd now mostly everyone seems to be wearing a collar.

Two of us showed up first and were brought to our seats.  An older gentleman came up to our table and asked for our drink orders...and then a younger gentleman came up a minute later for our drink orders.  I informed him that we had already been helped and thanked him.  After a few minutes, our original server brought out our drinks and a basket of tortilla chips with a tray or salsa, bean dip and guacamole to munch on.  This is one of the things I love about Mexican food restaurants, it's their version of a bread basket and it works so well, for me, because I love salsa and chips.\n\nAfter about ten more minutes, another of our party showed up and the same thing happened as before.  Older gentlemen gets her drink order and then the younger one does the same thing.  I'm curious, are they really so overstaffed that they need two people to check up on each other or are they just unaware of which sections each is supposed to cover?  No matter, since we were splitting the bill and crunched for time (and our fourth party was stuck in traffic), we order two appetizers to split.  \n\nAfter we ordered, my best friend noticed that our salsa, bean dip and guacamole was almost empty and the older gentleman was at our table so she asked him to send us a new one.  He looked directly at her as she made the request and then just turned around and walked away.  She gave his retreating back a funny look and then noticed that the younger gentleman was about to pass our table and stopped him for the same request.  He got a very nervous looks on his face, shook his head and informed us that this wasn't his section and he'd send our server over.  Really?  Then why were you asking for our drink orders and serving the two tables to the left and right of us?\n\nThe older server came out with his stern face in place and snidely informed my best friend that only the first bowl of salsa and dip is free, afterwards he would have to charge us $7.95.  Just so that everybody is aware, that's the price of an appetizer at this location.  My friend literally laughed at him and waved him away after I had informed him that this would be our once and only visit to this restaurant.  It amazes me that $7.95 is worth the loss of what might have been a repeat customer.\n\nAfter we ate, the older server handed us our bill of $25.30 and my two companions literally counted out 25 dollars and three dimes while I wrote on the note that they should be on the lookout for my upcoming one star yelp review and that the service was so horrible that I would not be back.  Three servers saw that I was writing on the bill and pointed us out in front of the restaurant while they whispered vehemently about us.  To top everything off, the server came and snatched up what we had left before we were even out of the booth and gave us a cold sneer for our \"generosity.\"  \n\nIt's actually a crying shame that I won't be back to this restaurant, especially in a town like Las Vegas where there can't be that many more Mexican food restaurants that would be willing to bestow decent service on a paying customer...right?", "type": "review", "business_id": "xl5w8jkI_9uhR10qGncH9A"}

I went here for the 1/2 off appetizers and 1/2 off drinks. Bottled beer was $2. The appetizers were around $4. I ordered the drunk shrimp and wings. The shrimp were very good and came with a variety of sauces to choose from. The wings were average, but they gave me a lot, 18. Don't know why, but good for me. They definitely have a party atmosphere, kind of like something you'd see in Cabo San Lucas . They have misters all over the patio. I liked everything about the atmosphere and prices on the appetizers and drinks. The only downfall is I thought the bartenders at the bar were all unfriendly. They never smiled or asked how the food was. If you're looking for \"personal and friendly\" bartenders, it's not here. I think they're too busy. It's a very busy place. The other thing they don't tell you, is they place a hold authorization on your card. My bill was $28. When I got home, I looked at my bank account. The bartender put a $25 hold on my card and a separate $75 hold on my card!! So, for my $28 bill, they had $100 pending on my account. I called and complained to the manager the very next day. He said it has to be my bank because they will never put a $75 hold on a card. He did say they do put the $25 on it. I confirmed with my bank it wasn't them. I called him back. I told him who the bartender was who did it. He was very nice and apologized, and said he had no idea why she would do that. I had to wait 3 days for the $100 authorization to drop off. I would've ranked this place 4 stars if the bartenders were at least a little friendly and they didn't put $100 hold on my card for just me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2KCHbRLC2e9b2tiFN5Gxww"}

It seems like the crowds only come around at night, so it is actually a very quiet and pleasant place to relax during the day.\nI love that the bartenders are actually knowledgeable about the liquors and menu. There are not too many things more annoying when your ordering a specialty drink, than dealing with an uneducated bartender that can't answer a single question you ask. The girl who poured my friend and I drinks was very knowledgeable, and therefore very helpful in assisting us with our drink selections.\nBeware that all drinks are poured with a heavy hand, and you are served not only your glass, but also the leftover shaker.

I have a lady VIP card and an industry card which entitles you to a free drink and happy hour all the time aside from their normal happy hour times which is from 4-8 pm. So if you're a girl, you must sign up for this incentive! \n\nThe food isn't too bad especially at happy hour prices, but I don't think I'd pay for it at normal price. I really really enjoy their lobster salad! It's very light and refreshing yet full of flavor. It has sliced avocados, mango, baby cherry tomatoes, mixed spring, romaine, and iceberg lettuce, and two pieces of lobster. To. Die. For! I also like their spinach and artichoke dip, both of their flatbread choices (margherita & beef tenderloin portobello), beef tenderloin dish, and chicken skewers. \n\nI ordered the baked Brie thinking it would be fantastic. The bread is pretty good, but the cheese for it tasted much too strong. It was brought out with the rest of my appetizers and I was meaning to eat it last which I did, but at that point the cheese seemed like it had hardened so it wasn't that good. The fruit on the plate also was not fresh and made me want to spit it out. \n\nThe service is hit or miss depending on the girl's attitude that is serving you that night. Most of them are pretty happy, but there have been instances where my waitress was very unpleasant. \n\nThe bands that play are fun most of the time, but I don't generally think of this place as somewhere to go to and dance. It naturally isn't meant for the younger crowd. As some of my friends call it, it is \"cougar town\"! Haha so watch out younger fellas. Most people that come here come after a long day's work to get a drink with their business peers and whatnot. It can get really loud in here too so it's hard to talk and socialize unless you're sitting outside, which can be a pain to find seating some nights. It can get very crowded!

BF and I got here around 7pm on a Thursday night and were rudely greeted by what I can only describe as a tool bag at the entrance asking us to get to the back of the line where we could be carded to come in. Once security deemed us old enough to enter, we walked into the patio area to search for a table or seats at the bar.  It was really nice outside, so this outdoor patio area was hoppin'.  \n\nAfter spending 10 minutes repeating what we JUST did in the parking lot (wandering around aimlessly for a spot), we gave up and went inside.  Inside the restaurant was rather empty so we grabbed a table easily.  The only problem was that it was FREEZING inside.  I felt like whatever table we were at, cold air was blowing directly on me.  We decided to brave it out.\n\nA nice friendly waitress came over and informed us it was still happy hour, to our extreme pleasant surprise.  He ordered a dirty martini with blue cheese-stuffed olives, and I ordered the Mango Madness.  Both were okay.  Mine was a little sweeter than I'd like, and his just wasn't 100%, but we did end up ordering one more each, so they must not have been that bad.\n\nFor food, we ordered the margarita flat bread, the sliced sirloin, fruit and cheese plate, and crab cakes.\n\nLet's start with the bad (because I like people to leave my reviews on a good note).  The crab cakes were super mushy.  The flavor was mediocre at best, but they just completely fell apart when you went to get a piece of it with your fork.  It was really more of a crab mush than a crab CAKE.  The breading was not crispy at all and just didn't add anything to the dish.  It was served with an orangish drizzle that could have been spicy mayo.  I think whatever it was, it was the dish's only saving grace because it had a delicious flavor.\n\nThe next bad dish was the fruit and cheese plate.  What a disappointment.  I'm sorry, but when I order a fruit and cheese plate at a place like Blue Martini, I would expect the cheese to NOT include baby bells.  There was a slab of goat cheese in the middle, a few squares of swiss, and two baby bells, along with an array of fruit and crackers.  There was only one strawberry on the plate and it was more green than it was red.  The whole plate, which was very large, was a complete disappointment and we ended up wasting most of it.\n\nOkay, onto the good.  The sliced tenderloin plate was so delicious.  The slices of tenderloin (which is what a filet mignon is cut from) were so tender and juicy.  The dish came with some rice pilaf and a horseradish sauce.  All of the flavors combined were perfectly well-balanced and made a delicious dish.\n\nLast, the margarita pizza was amazing.  So simple and yet so complex.  The crust was just the right amount of crispy.  The tomatoes complimented the light but flavorful cheese just right.  \n\nOur server also brought my BF extra olives for his second martini because she saw me eating them out of his glass.  She was really sweet, friendly and we never had to wait on her so that was a huge plus.  If not for her service, I may have given the martini a sad 2-stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "84bLhe1aibxNmogtqSO4rA"}

Inside ZJ is bright, cheery and quirky - a great fit for the location. The menu is inspired and offers up a ton of egg-y options for breakfast, but I'm personally more of a carbo-loaded sweet fan for my morning meal. I know, healthy.\n\nBut I stayed away from their pancakes and french toast to try out the Zada Janer - a simple, straight forward breakfast with eggs your style (my choice: scrambled), a protein (my choice: turkey bacon), a carb (my choice: fruit cup), and toast. The meal was just fine but nothing to write home about. My eggs were a little dry - maybe I'll ask for some cheesy scramblies next time? The fruit cup was generous and fresh and the turkey bacon was just so-so. For $8 this was plenty of food for me, but I can see how it could be perceived as a bit steep for bigger appetites. \n\nI want to love Zada Janes as the service is laid back and friendly and it's so cute and homey inside, but for now I just like it.

Thank goodness there's only a ton of ATMs on the Carnegie Mellon and U. Pitt campus.\n\nCost:   ~ 7 dollars a crepe depending on what you get\n\nThe ordering process is similar to Panera, and La Madeline, where you order, grab a number, and sit down.  Someone will bring the food over and that will probably be the last time you see him/her.  From ordering to receiving food took about 5 minutes or so.\n\nFood Experience from beginning to end:\nI really loooove crepes, especially sweet crepes.  It's a bit past lunch time and I'm starving.  My sister and I walk in and there's a bunch of folks in there, talking and having a good time.  This place was happening!  This place isn't exactly big.  The seating area is pretty small but it was pretty cozy.  The atmosphere is pretty good as well.  When we walked in, we grabbed the last open table and it wasn't even peak dining time!  I can easily see this place get crowded during lunchtime.\n\nThe menu has savory crepes and sweet crepes - savory being the an actual meal, and of course sweet is for dessert.  My sister and I wanted both for lunch so we ordered one of each and decided to split.  \n\nFor the savory crepe, we tried out the breakfast crepe which contains sausage, egg and cheese.  It comes with a small spinach and mandarin orange salad on the side with a small container of oil and vinagrette dressing.  The salad is very good but also very small.  It's not really there as a side dish but as something there to complement the crepe.  The size of the crepe is not that big as well.  it measured probably 3in by 4 in.  The crepe itself was nothing to write home about.   It contained little salt which is great for me, but for salt lovers out there, this is not the crepe for you.\n\nAs for the dessert crepe, I really wanted nutella with fresh strawberries and bananas.  Unfortunately, they don't serve that since they don't have fresh strawberries, just fresh bananas.  The only kind of berries they have is this compote that is super sugary.  Between the rich nutella spread and the berry compote, it was pretty sweet.  The crepe is topped with a generous portion of whipped cream.  The whip cream is actually not sweet at all.  I ate my crepe with the cream to balance out the sugar a bit.   \n\nIn summary, I think this place is really cute for atmosphere and nice to have when you need a crepe fix.  It's really a nice place to hang out with friends and crepes are easily sharable.

I will say Vegas doesn't have many tapas places though I wish I could go to spain for the real-deal but this place is really fun to go with friends!\n\nThe blacken salmon tacos are really good. Even if you're not a fan of salmon or seafood tacos just try them! The aioli sauce makes the favor so outstanding! I didn't want to order these my sister did and I tried hers and sense then placed an order each time I've gone. \n\nThey play diff. music each time I go and it's always really enjoyable atmosphere, although a couple of the times I went the music was too loud to talk.

After delving off menu a few times, I think it's the most solid they have to offer. \n\nMy  favorites out of the hot dog is the Las Vegas chili dog or chicago dogs. I also often get the sausages, mostly hot links. Hot dogs are Boars head so they have natural casings or you can get other types without the snap, even a white hot dog/veal one. Sides wise their fried green beans with wasabi mayo is really good. To drink get Sprechers root beer off the tap! Also their raspberry ice tea isn't that regular Lipton soda fountain stuff, it's brewed so that is good too. \n\nStick with that and I think you'll have a good dinner here. Cheap, good American type food.\n\nSeeing as they won some \"best of\" burgers,  thought their burgers would be fantastic, but it isn't any different from any old greasy spoon. Also fish type stuff, is pre battered so not anything you can't do at home with some Gordon's. I feel like some stuff is offered, just to offer it. I thought the turkey burgers, grilled chicken sandwiches and tuna melt were decent though. \n\nMy one thing about this place is that do not come at peak hours. I don't know if the owner is too cheap to hire another person but they really need more than one waitress, there's never been two waitresses I've ever seen. We went recently where it hit max capacity in this small place and she was in the weeds the whole time. It was hard to flag her down for some extra sauce, I had to wait a long time by the cash register, I just got up to serve ourselves some drinks (good thing I did not get raspberry tea that was behind the register). She already is running around like mad even when it's not a full house so they really need two people at least during the rush. It's not fair to the poor gal or to customers. I know it's not her fault, but some people were upset...and it sucks if she gets crapped on for something she cannot control at all. I'm going to stick with going only in the odd hours. I don't like going to a place and get no service. \n\nOverall though, I like this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-584fn2GxYe9sLsgN2WeQA"}

However, once we arrived, we were told it was at the bar area only. Whomp. The bar area is super small but we managed to snag a little table and squeeze all of our bodies around it. Not the most comfortable seating, but it'll have to do.\n\nWe ordered everything on their happy hour menu. All the dishes were about $5 and we wanted to try everything. Unfortunately our waitress came back 3 times just to tell us that they \"no longer had this item on their happy hour menu\". BOGUS!

So instead of eating, we decided to just drink and ate whatever few things they did have on happy hour. We ordered some rolls off their regular menu and they were all lacking.

Flawless service, excellent food, and the DJ-rocking atmosphere put Sushisamba at the top of my list for great Las Vegas dining. At first, I was skeptical. Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian dishes?

His were spot on, plus he took excellent care of our table all evening. Jimmy suggested we give him a price point per diner, and then he delivered a sumptuous multi-course meal, taking us on a culinary trip to all three countries in under two hours. Oh, and did I mention I have a food allergy? Sushisamba didn't even blink. After my Celiac diagnosis three years ago, I thought I had to give up \"chef's choice\" or prix fixe meals. Not here. While most of our courses were GF, when they weren't the kitchen prepared GF versions especially for me, and I didn't have to agonize over my choices or worry about my safety. Sushisamba took care of everything.\n\nAnd what dishes they were! Start off with a caipirinha, the signature drink of Brazil, and then let your server delight your senses. A few of the highlights: the tuna tataki; yellowtail taquitos; miso-marinated sea bass; and the moqueca mista. The moqueca mista was the crowd-pleaser of the evening, a beautiful seafood dish with the tastiest chimichurri rice I've ever had. But the star of the evening was the sushi.

Doing my research for steak houses in Vegas this one always made some of the top list by user reviews.  \n\nService-  I made a reservation well in advance which was good because we were seated right away.  The server was very kind and knowledgeable about the menu.  She answered all our questions.   She told us the specials up front which was nice.  So overall the service was good.\n\nThe food-  To start we had the Hot Rock appetizer.  It is pretty gimmicky but its something you have to do.  They basically bring a rock out that is heated to 900 degrees and you cook thinly sliced sirloin on it for a few seconds.  At 17 bucks its pretty pricey for the 6 thinly sliced pieces of sirloin you get.  The flavor was good but price wise they should have included a little bit more meat or something in addition to it.\n\nFor our main dish my wife ordered the kobe short ribs 36 bucks and I ordered the ribeye 49 bucks.  We also shared baked mac and cheese and some parker house rolls (they are not on the menu but I recommend because they are free).\n\nThe Kobe Short Ribs are nothing to write home about.  For kobe beef it sure tasted about average.  The meat was actually a little under seasoned for my taste.  \n\nThe Baked Mac and Cheese was great.  The crust on the top was very tasty and the cheese not to greasy.  This side was full of flavor no complaints.\n\nThe Ribeye steak.   This is where my whole meal got ruined.  Now a ribeye is my absolute favorite cut.  It is supposed to be juicy and melt in your mouth.  I always pick the most marbled cut that I possibly can when I shop for one and I would expect a high end steak house to do the same.  For starters I got my steak medium rare.  It was absolutely burnt on the outside.  All the wonderful fat was crispy and tasted like pure well burnt no if ands or buts about it.  To give them the benefit of the doubt I cut into the middle which was rare but instead of a tender peace of meat my steak knife had trouble cutting it.  It was rubber!  I couldn't get passed the burnt parts to fully enjoy my 49 dollar steak.  I was expecting luxury but it came out no better then something you could get at Denny's.  It ruined my whole dining experience.  The cook must have been having an off day because the table behind us sent back their steaks also.  \n\nOverall for the value I would avoid this place.  There are better steakhouses who take pride in what they serve to their customers.  Just because you charge a fortune does not mean you are good.  \n\nI am giving this place a one star simply because I was expecting something amazing and got all my hopes dashed. \n\nTo be fair the manager did agree with my complaints about the steak and refunded us for it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "U6stLkJYMaro_4-3KI84_Q"}

I got up to pay for my bill and to my surprise, there was no discount or any sort of accommodation. \n\nI am disappointed with them and will not be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2mcmuAvpNIJuV3gV0v9v2A"}

Highly suspect.  Our waiter introduces himself and explains that the restaurant is tapas-style Chinese cuisine.  In order to properly feed our group of 10, we would have to order 2 of everything.  \n\nThe culprits: Baby back ribs w/ honey tamarind glaze ($10).  These were ok.  Nothing special.  Spicy Thai shrimp with garlic basil lettuce wraps ($10).  A little too salty for our liking.  Calamari w/ serrano peppers ($15): this was probably one of my favorites.  Crispy with some heat to it.  Lemon chicken ($21): pass...pass...pass.  Lastly my other favorite of the evening was steak served over grilled rice (similar to grilled onigiri).  Delicious.  \n\nOverall, the food was just ok.

The atmosphere is delightfully peaceful but yet screams excitement. Two of my favorite resturant entrepreneur's are Rick Bayless, in Chicago, and Sam Fox.  Both these men shit liguid gold when it comes the geniusness of restaurant concepts.  The staff is as warm and friendly as the pope is.  My date and I walked in and were greeted with a \"Welcome back, Kelly.\" She works in the hospitality industry and seems to know almost everyone.  We sat down and within a min out server was over getting our drink order. After throwing out my witty sarcastic comments at him, we ordered. She ordered a sangria and I got suckered into the special drink they were offering. It was called the Valente and I was on cloud nine when it hit my lips. Jim Beam, red bell pepper, basil, lemon juice and honey. I sucked that down like I was in the Sahara and found water after a week without any. It was magical. Kelly looked at me like I was an alcoholic when I ordered another. After deliberating over the amazing menue, it was time to order. We both decided to get pizza's and share. She ordered the mushroom and arugula pizza and I got the sausage and pepperoni. Good fire brick pizza is my favorite food right behind ribs and NoRTH is the best in Phoenix. Your dumb if you dissagree. I made that pizza my bitch and dominated it but leaving 2 slices for lunch the next day. Well that was my intent. It didnt last long after I stepped through my front door.\n\nI will always recommend any of the Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurants to any and all my friends/enemies", "type": "review", "business_id": "LfKPiwth-lGmCKTxlDoV9g"}

They have two things I really like, good food and Coke products.\n\nHaving lived in Chicago most of my life I am very hard on restaurants. \n\nThis one has many good qualities. \n\nThe owners actually work there. This was the first time I ate here even though I had been by it many times. Once I even looked at the menu. It did not have Saganaki on it so I did not go in. I continued to eat at The Big Ft Greek although in the past year the quality had gone down and the prices had gone up.\n\nNow back to Pitta Souvli. It is in a strip mall hidden in the back where they probably don't get any drive by traffic unless someone is looking to buy a bicycle next door.\n\nMy friend and I started off with the Hummus. It was a decent size serving for 2-3 people for about $4. The taste was good and it did have the slight sesame flavor of real hummus.\n\nThe next thing we got was the Egg Lemon Soup. A Chicken and Rice Soup ($3.50 for a cup) with egg and lemon. Very good flavor and not over salted. \n\nI had the Beef Souvli or Beef Kabob Sandwich $6.50. The beef was flavorfull and tender and not one piece had that vein or fat that you get in many sandwiches. The seasoning was very good and not overpowering.\n\nMy friend had the Gyro $5.50 and Fries $2.50. Again very good flavor and not supper greasy. The fries were crispy and seasoned with season salt. Not too thin or too thick. \n\nThe service was excellent and the prices were reasonable. \n\nWhile we were their we met the owner and his wife. They had both met working for Big Fat Greek. George was from Cypress. He told us that most of his employees have been there since they started over a year ago. They have many specials and everything is made fresh. They do have Saganaki. It is a special item that is only on the menu a couple of times a week but if you ask for it they will make it anytime. They age their own cheese for it on the premises. \n\nNext time I am going to try the Lamb Souvli as George promises that it is some of the most tender lamb you will ever eat. I would also like to try the Greek Potatoes as well. \n\nPlease eat here as many of the places I like cannot survive in a city were everybody prefers National Chains over quality family owned businesses.\n\nIf you care about decor as well as food you will like this place as well. Me, I just care about the food and not the atmosphere. Being from Chicago I'll eat food standing up at a counter in a modified garage if the food is good.\n\nEat here. If your disappointed you have no Idea what good food should taste like.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9em_vfSjwcPqQgU8Zj-hzA"}

If you can find a parking spot. \n\nStopped in for some late afternoon lunch at what is known as the MetroCenter location (even though technically it is just outside of 'Metro' off of 30th ave and Peoria). Even at around 3pm there was a nice little line there, though it moved quickly enough for me. This location stays pretty busy and there aren't many times when there isn't a line. \n\n\nThe food? \n\nFresh and good. They do a great job there and the quality was fine by my snobbish Chipotle standards, which I acquired over my many years of eating burrito bowls and epic-sized burritos and chips. Anyway, the atmosphere is also nice and they keep this location clean. They also stop by your table and ask you how everything is and if there is anything else you need (while your stuffing your face full of beans, rice and chicken), my answer is always a muffled \"mmm, gweat\" as I try not to appear rude but also not wishing to speaking with my mouth full. \n\nThe parking? \n\nNot so great. It shares a lot with what seems like two other strip malls that are adjacent and sometimes parking can really be challenge of suburban proportions. I got lucky this last time but I've also have gotten frustrated before trying to get in a spot, fighting a Tahoe, and avoiding glares from 40 something year old women as I beeline to the Chipotle door trying not to look at them after out maneuvering them for a spot. This is really my only negative with this location. The parking isn't great. \n\nOther than that, I love the food, the staff, the atmosphere of the location, and getting one over on the suburban mom/professional parking lot navigator, who normally swipes my spot with four kids inside and offers only a heartless sunglass-laden glance as I try to find another parking spot with my head down after getting worked over by them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q"}

The coconut shrimp was perfectly cooked and the slaw and the salad tasted fresh and refreshing. I could totally imagine myself eating those items on a tropical island beach.

The food was elegant and well executed, though some of the dishes had less than outstanding flavor overall. The service was pleasant, though the pacing on that night was difficult. We couldn't get a reservation that night, but we showed up at opening and got seated at the bar - really not a bad deal because you do get to watch the chefs in motion.\n\nWhile I sampled many dishes, these were my main hits and misses...\n\nBy and far the most unique and pleasant flavor of the evening was the Udon Noodle with Foie Gras Egg Custard Soup - Extremely rich and flavorful with a unique style to it. Thin cold udon noodles weren't exactly my favorite idea - I actually felt like a warm noodle soup would be fine. But still, there was an amazing depth of flavor with this dish, and a unique presentation on top of it.\n\nThe Hamachi Kama was a huge piece of fish collar with a ton of flavor and was very tender. This was also a great value being priced under 20 dollars for the amount of fish on the actual plate.\n\nThe Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi was something I really tried on a whim - really kind of unique in that it has a slimy but incredibly smooth texture, I wasn't sure I loved the flavor but the special salt they had at the table side really helped enhance what was already there. It was unique, but I doubt I'd try it again.\n\nWhile the Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic was really good, I didn't really enjoy the fillet with wasabi - it was too lean and the wasabi overwhelmed the flavor. The Tsukune-Grilled Ground Chicken was a bit of a disappointment as well - I've had similar at Kyara and it was no better nor any different. The duck and lamb were each average to me - the duck had a good texture, but I didn't care for the presentation or the overall flavor. The lamb was marinated which really covers up the flavor of the lamb and because it was an apple marinade, it came out rather sweet.\n\nOne of the highlights of the evening was the dessert - a fluffy cheese cake which had a texture closer to a cloud rather than the heavy cheese cake that is typical. The sweetness was muted as well, but it was still absolutely delicious.\n\nUnfortunately I felt that the service was a little less than stellar because the pacing of the dishes was rather iffy. After the appetizers, we waited about 20 minutes for the Hamachi Kama, and then suddenly all the grilled items were coming out faster than we could eat.\n\nStill, I had some very memorable bites of food here that I will think back upon for a while. It was pricey, but definitely not astronomical by any means.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw"}

Right after I had already ordered my sandwich and the girl behind the counter already started making my sandwich a tray of some delicious looking breakfast pockets came out of the oven.  Kind of missed out on those pockets, there was a line just for those.  Their roast beef and provolone sandwiches came with roast beef, provolone cheese, tomato, thin flat bread, and a horseradish dressing which I had them also add chipotle mayo.

I naturally gravitate toward the sandwich genre, and more specifically, the chicken sandwich genre.  I really am trying to expand, but...baby steps.  \n\nI ordered the chicken Parmesan hot sub/grinder.  It is served with marinara sauce, onions, Parmesan and mozzarella cheese on French bread.  The only change I made was to have the marinara sauce served on the side.  I do this because I find that most restaurants that prepare chicken Parmesan prepare the sandwich first, and they apply the sauce too soon prior to serving it.  When the sandwich is served the bread becomes soggy which really kills the experience for me.  As a result, I have become accustomed to ordering the sauce on the side.\n\nThe sandwich was very, very good.  In fact, I would actually rate Amante's as having one of the best chicken Parmesan sandwiches to be ranked with some of the greats like DeFalcos, Meatballz or Yo Paulies.\n\nThe chicken is prepared grilled and then diced and topped with a generous amount of Parmesan and surprisingly sweet red onions.  Occasionally the French bread housing is burned or over-cooked, but not to an unacceptable level.  The sandwich really does hold up to the price tag and I usually finish the entire thing, leaving me quite full.\n\nMy father ordered the same as myself and it was prepared the same way.\n\nWe also ordered a pizza for the table.  We didn't go bold or try anything special - straight cheese pizza.  It arrived piping hot and we found the pizza to be standard fare, nothing ultra impressive but still good enough to keep us wanting another few slices.  One thing we noticed was the size.  The photographed pizza is actually a medium, which serves a hefty 6 slices of pizza.\n\nMy wife ordered the spaghetti and meat sauce.  The spaghetti was pretty standard, nothing fancy - big fat tasty noodles.  The meat sauce was what I would also consider average.  This was the first time we have ever ordered pasta at Amante's and my wife's initial reaction to the sauce was that it was too thick.  The taste was alright, but the consistency was very...pasty.  The presentation was great and the fresh parmesan and garlic bread compliment the overpowering sauce.\n\n[End Food Excerpt]", "type": "review", "business_id": "MPmSoEd46WXqhN-5rw7Yqw"}

Everything tasted great, fresh and with a great imagination in their creation.  I am sure that we will visited again soon!", "type": "review", "business_id": "aHerF5k5pkMDTdNSpIdTyw"}

My parents live in the area and eat here all the time and have had none of the same problems. \n\nThis is the worst service I have had at a restaurant in recent memory. The food was fine (what of it they had) but the service was absolutely mind-blowingly bad. \n\nFirst of all, our server didn't write anything down. I HATE it when servers do this, especially at small restaurants. We asked if the Arizona Cheesesteak had bell peppers - the server took the menu out of my boyfriend's hand, perused it, and continued to take my order. I gave my order - tuna sandwich with sweet potato fries. The server nodded and continued to look through the menu. After a few more seconds he asked us to repeat our order and then said \"Oh sorry we're out of sweet potatoes\". Okay, whatever, just chips then.\n\nDuring the rest of our wait for our food we couldn't help but overhear the table behind us, who was having a really hard time with their meals. Their pancakes were cold and had to be sent back and they had no silverware. Their eggs weren't cooked properly and they were just in general pretty unhappy. \n\nOur server came to check on us during the wait for no apparent reason, saying \"I'll go check on your food\". Instead of doing that he proceeded to hang out behind the bar and chat with some other servers, very visibly NOT checking on our food. A few minutes later a different server emerged from the kitchen with our food. \n\nMy sandwich was fine - was supposed to come with a pickle and a cookie. I asked another (now third) server about the pickle and was informed that they were out. I didn't even bother asking about the cookie - I got the distinct impression that I was bothering everyone and seriously impinging on the staff's ability to chat behind the bar. \n\nAs we were finishing up our waiter returned and said \"So I guess your food wasn't good?\". My boyfriend and I looked at each other and said \"No, it was fine. I think that was the other table behind us.\" The server then proceeded to sigh visibly and say \"Oh good, it wasn't my table.\"\n\n\"Oh good, it wasn't my table.\"\n\n\"Oh good, it wasn't my table.\"\n\n\"Oh good, it wasn't my table.\"\n\nMy boyfriend and I stared at each other in shock for a few minutes before paying and leaving. \n\nWhat. \n\nThe. \n\nHell.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Oqm8u_eI_LVXOMAJ4wzP9g"}

Ok, small issues with customer service (when they tried to convince me \"usuzukuri\" was a type of fish and not the preparation of it), but the food made up for it. \n\nWe arrived around 6:30, and ordered about 10 minutes later. My father's entree arrived in about 15 minutes, a decent Chicken Katsu. My mother and my appetizers arrived a few minutes later. The first was Hamachi Sashimi that was so fishy-smelling and slimy, after one piece each we returned them to the waiter. He made no comment about it, not even the basic apology we usually expect when one returns inedible food.\n\nThe green salad was nice, the salmon tartare decent but nothing to write home about. \n\nAbout 50 minutes later, we received one more dish, the salmon/tuna tempura, my ABSOLUTE favourite Mikado roll, and were told our Jazz roll was \"coming.\" This roll is lightly seared and then tempura fried - but when it got to us it was so cold it felt like it had just come out of the fridge, and the tempura was chewy.

However, since they did not have the courtesy to even respond, I will now post it on Yelp.\n\nWe dined at Verses a Friday in November expecting excellent service and meal execution.  Neither occurred.  We were clearly an afterthought to our server, but that is the lesser of the issues.  It was the food that failed and was so extremely disappointing, especially for the price.  But, this review has nothing to do with price.  We dined at Au Pied de Cochon the previous evening and spent an equivalent amount, however the level of attentiveness and quality and execution of the dishes was so far above that of Verses.  \n\nWe had four dishes, and I would have been forgiving of one dish below expectation.  However, when 3 of the 4 are almost inedible, I feel the need to address the situation.\n\nWe started with the foie gras torchon (as expected) and the sweetbread.  The sweetbread was very minimal and completely overcooked, dry and falling apart as we attempted to eat it.  It lacked flavor and the richness typically associated with the dish.\n\nFrom there we had the wild boar and the cod with poached egg.  The boar was overcooked - certainly not the medium rare we ordered - as well as tough, chewy and flavorless.  It reminded me of a cheap pork chop.  The cod was extremely overdone - dry and cold.  The 'poached' egg was hard-cooked. \n\nHad our server come to check on us, we would have mentioned these issues.  He did not.\n\nLast, we ordered dessert and coffee for my husband.  Our dessert came.  The coffee arrived about 10 minutes later.  By then we had no dessert.  \n\nThere are many better options in Old Montreal than this pretentious, ill-performing restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3bx6Se8Fu8D6tzGfpW2oqQ"}

I was able to walk-in on one of the more popular restaurants in the city (called for reservations and weren't taking any for a week!). Joe Beef is a small place split off into two different dining areas, with one being the main and the other being a lounge of sorts with the bar. The menu is a chalkboard that hangs high against the wall and consists entirely of French. Within the walls of this tiny little establishment, lay a place that had the intimate feel you look for when you're with your significant other, with food that would put you into a coma. \n\nWe started the night with eel nuggets....yeah...eel nuggets. There were a lot of starters that looked very good including the foie gras double down, but eel nuggets had to be ordered because I had no idea what that would even taste like. As soon as she saw it on the menu, the gf knew she was getting the Lobster Spaghetti. Likewise, as soon as I saw Duck on the menu, I was getting that.\n\nThe Eel nuggets are exactly what they sound like. The nuggets were real crunchy as I think they were breaded with cornflakes. The eel filling itself was a mix of eel and potato, so it had a pasty kind of texture. The eel and potato mixture was overly salty while the breading added no real flavor. There was a good hint of smokiness to go along with the app, but I didn't really enjoy it. In fact, it just tasted odd in a bad sort of way. Luckily, the entrees were tremendous. \n\nMy entree was the Duck with Montreal Smoked Meat. The name itself was enough to ensure that I ordered it. The Duck breast was parted into thick cuts of meat that made it so satisfying and savory. The dish came garnished with small bits of smoked meat and oddly enough, pickles. Surprisingly, the pickles with the duck worked for me. The sauce was savory as well, and the smoked meat did not serve to overpower the duck but add to the dish as a whole. \n\nLobster Spaghetti is simply that. Giant chunks of lobster (shell-on) were tossed with spaghetti in a buttery cream sauce. The lobster meat was very tender and the spaghetti soaked in all that lobster-y brininess. The butter and cream sauce lends itself to being quite heavy, but the gf claims it was one of her favorite dishes ever.\n\nIf the food wasn't good enough, the service was excellent. Our server Andrew was always around and making sure we were well taken care of despite how busy the place was slowly getting. He was friendly, funny, and seemed like one of the guys who just happened to bring you food. The place, despite it's fame and reputation, doesn't exude a feeling of pretention at all. I fully enjoyed the entire experience and thus truly earned my 5 star rating. Best restaurant in Montreal. Period.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tK9gTB4bj4Z-iQ1daqkK7w"}

What is really key, key, key about this restaurant is that everything without exception is prepared fresh, from scratch. Nothing is prepared in advance and warmed up or stocked up in the morning for the days clientele. That's why service can sometimes take a little bit of time but the extra wait is well worth the delicious fresh indian fare you are enjoying there.\nThe masala dosa which is a very large very thin cr\u00eape stuffed with potatoes is absolutely unbelievable. Priced at about five dollars it can easily satisfied a small Appetite. The spicy version of the masala dosa is just as good. My go to meal there has to be the tandoori chicken plate.\nIt consists of three generous deliciously grilled pieces of chicken accompanied by rice and a generous piece of naan.

I work in a restaurant, so I don't expect her to kiss my feet but at least try to be a little less cold when I am paying 40 for a steak (not including a side). Bad service can ruin the whole meal. Our drinks were often empty, the bread that they serve while the spreads are very good, you need superman strength to cut through the crust on the bottom (with a steak knife). I had the filet and salmon from the two course summer menu. My steak was tasty, but as soon as I got to the thicker part of my salmon, I could tell right away that it was undercooked. Let the waitress know and instead of letting me finish my steak, she took the whole plate and I sat there watching my boyfriend eat his steak. To make up for it the manager offered a free dessert, now who will make up for our server's crappy attitude????  When we tried to pay, our server informed us that we could not use two promotions together, and I told her that I called ahead of time. She had to check with the manager, came back to the table for the check and I asked what the manager said \"Oh I forgot to ask him, hold on\". Really it was a Monday night not busy at all.

I like tiramisu that is rich in flavor-sweet mascarpone, but not cloyingly so, and rich espresso taste, no greasy mouth-feel, and not too light and fluffy, and this was perfect!  (I asked for the powdered sugar to be omitted.)  The chocolate cake is also a must-have!  It was a lot denser than the tiramisu-- almost flourless in texture, or at least the part I ate from was (the outer edge of the cake).  Too bad the busser threw out our take-out containers of sweet treats... They're pricey!  (Tiramisu was almost $6, and the chocolate cake was $8, but come to think of it, the cake slice was huge.)  I even labeled and dated them, but not even two minutes had passed when I thought I'd forgotten my phone and ran in to retrieve it, and our table had already been cleared, and the busser didn't even bat an eye.  We didn't notice that the desserts were missing until we were home.  \n\nMake sure you check the tab for accuracy!!\n\np.s.  The Honey Brown lived up to its name, and I definitely preferred it after sampling the bitter hef, but the beer kept impressing me as I ate the calamari (awesome combo) and then progressed to the pizza.

I don't want to embarrass I-Sushi so I won't mention their name.  I knew redemption was needed and needed quick.\n\nMy visit was during lunch time and chose their AYCE for $21.99. I want to add that from the outside, this joint looks bigger than it really is.  The ambiance was perfect around 11:40 AM for someone eating alone and we all know for the best service, you have eat at the bar near the sushi artists. There was only one other patron here at the time. That only lasted about 20 minutes because once noon hit, the fans started showing up. Every seat was taken and a line was forming by 12:30 PM. Just keeping up with the Jones'. Just another sign that Blue Fin is the way to go.\n\nI had a couple of items for my AYCE venture;\n-Nigiri: Yellowtail, Salmon, and the Garlic Spicy Tuna\n-Rolls:  Tried their Rock and Roll, which is a cucumber wrapped roll with crab, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail\n-Hand Rolls: Spicy Crab and the Crunch Shrimp\n\nEverything I've tried was delicious and fresh. I thought that the Nigiri's were small, but it's all you can eat. Order more if it's not enough.  I did just that, I ordered and ordered until I was able to erase my last poor experience in San Diego.  To be honest, the food was so satisfying here that just my first nigiri already made up for it.\n\nThis review cannot end without commenting on the service. 5 stars for service alone. Even though I was just one of about forty that was eating here, they made me feel like a rockstar (no, not the energy drink).  Watch these guys in action. Rolls, bowls, and shashimi's ordered and delivered with the quickness. All it takes is some eye contact and they're ready to take your request.\n\nMy only gripe about this place...it's on the opposite side of town from where I am normally at.

I AM IN LOVE WITH CHRISTOPHERS! Delish~! \n\nI usually only eat at the high end froofy restaurants a couple times a year. 1 because prices are high and 2 the servings usually small and let us not forget the Ala cart menu's. Lets face it up scale dining has come to sauces as a side dish. Never the less I like to be adventurous and splurge now and then! \n\nI really like the decor the ginormous front door is cool and it opens to a very elegant, hip and trendy kind of suave atmosphere. I'm diggin the kitchen in the middle of the restaurant too. The funky board listing the specials and the almost unisex bathroom. Be careful here that you choose the correct side. The sink is fun except when you reach under the trickles of water and find yourself bumping your hand against someone on the other side. Yeah it happened to me :P \n\nI started with the Jasmin blackberry infused green tea. Yum! Mind you it is lunchtime so no liquor for me thanks. Although I maybe could have used just a sip or two today. I chose the butter poached lobster, arugula, pine nut and roasted fennel vinaigrette salad. WOW that was tasty and large enough to split with a friend so I did.\n\nFor the main course I selected the Smoked truffle infused filet Mignon! OH YEAH MOMMY LIKES~! OMG I know it is over used but OMG! This steak was so delectable I wanted another for desert. Is that wrong? It comes with your choice of 3 sauces to compliment it. I think a Bearnaise, I know a red wine reduction or a brandy peppercorn. I chose the brandy peppercorn, but this steak was so outstanding I didn't want to ruin it with my fork. Let alone a sauce. Do I ordered it on the side. I did try the sauce and it was heaven. So I used it to dip my veggie mix in. Heck ya I'm a little silly like that. \n\nLets just say if this was a meal eaten at home the plate would have been licked clean! By far hands down the best filet I have eaten to date. I am from the Midwest and we ate steak at least once a week. This steak was amazing, delectable, outstanding, stupendous and did I say good? \n\nThe service was spot on! Our server knew everything about the menu and described everything in great detail! Bravo!\n\nGo now and eat it! Christopher I could kiss you! You get 10 steak knives up for that meal.  THANKS, your latest groupie~\n\nPS. Diners leave your kids at home, this is no place for them ever! Go hire a sitter, if you can afford to eat here you can afford to pay someone to watch your screaming child so I don't have to.

It was our anniversary, and we looked forward to a similar experience for dinner.  Unfortunately, we were really let down and both agreed to not give it another shot -- especially given the high price.  A lot of reviews here talk about Happy Hour, so maybe that would have been a better experience but we won't be going back to find out.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown:\n\nservice 4 stars - very friendly and courteous.  No complaints here at all.  The only ding is that he served diet coke that was clearly flat and we could not spot one bubble in the glass.  The second one was a bit better but still flat.   18% gratuity was automatically added which was sort of strange, but I would have tipped him at least that much anyway.\n\nlobster bisque 3 stars (had way more cream & less lobster taste)\n\ntruffle-infused filet mignon 3 stars - we ordered this medium, it came medium-well to well.  Was lukewarm and the truffle-flavor was very subtle and easy to miss.  Flavor was overall average.\n\nDuck 2-ways 3.5 stars - no complaints here but did not blow us away\n\nsouffle - 1 star - This was probably the worse souffle we've ever had.  It was missing some ingredient, but did not have substance or taste.  presentation looked very good though.  We've had this at Zinc Bistro and other french restaurants in the valley and this one was disappointing", "type": "review", "business_id": "1M4oczf2lmkdgbrJ3J7OqA"}

I think I had't been to Christopher's sooner because of it's location. I'm usually at the Biltmore shopping and spending too much money at the Apple Store. So I usually walk on by to head home play with my new toy(s).\n\nSo I finally made a conscious effort to go and I was pretty sure upon walking in that I would regret not coming sooner. I had a few drinks at Crush lounge and though tiny, it fit the bill for an actual lounge. So many places call themselves lounges when they're just a bar trying to glorify themselves.\n\nCrush is a true lounge-a small scale version of what you might find at a boutique hotel:intimate, dimly lit, good music and private spaces to enjoy a cocktail with someone special. I have to make it an effort to come here for cocktails more often because the vibe here is usually what I'm looking for-mental note made.\n\nAfter drinks we took a seat at the Kitchen Bar, where it was awesome to watch Christopher and his team at working creating culinary works of art. I went on a Monday where I was able to take advantage of one of their specials: grilled tenderloin with au gratin potatoes for $20. SCORE!!!!! It was served sliced up and served with a Cabernet reduction which was delicious. I also got to try some mushroom and arugula pizza which was served on such heavenly crust. Everything was c'est magnifique!\n\nI really have to applaud them as well for a top notch wine list. I LOVE South African wine and there are very few places in the U.S. that  feature on their wine list. So as if I wasn't happy enough with my meal and the experience this little extra plus is what earned them five stars in my book.\n\nThis is a very nice place and I can't wait to bring my family here. I'm sure a lot of folks may overlook this place if they're busy shopping. If nothing else, stop in for lunch and see why you need ot make it back for dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1M4oczf2lmkdgbrJ3J7OqA"}

If you have alot of PATIENCE and don't mind waiting 15 minutes to order and another 20 minutes for a chef to start cooking.\n2. If you are on a DIET and want to spend a lot of money on a small portion of good tasting food.\n3. If you don't really mind if you get drink refills, and don't mind sitting for 10 minutes with your mouth on fire.\n4.

If you don't mind paying 20% gratuity for a party over 8, but are told that it is only an automatic 18% for large parties.\n\nMy husband spent 12 years in the restaurant business and always comes to the defense of a server because he is empathetic of the challenges of the position, AND this was the rare occasion that he asked to speak to management. He was very disappointed with his portion of the filet mignon and scallops. The filet was smaller than half of your palm and he received a measly 3 scallops. The worst thing was the amount of vegetables which normally are used to fill up the plate but could have been placed in the same sized small bowl that we received our $4 fried rice in. We were sharing the filet and scallops and added a rice thinking that was an additional portion, but a small bowl was the only portion we received....except for the spoonful of rice that was left over and placed on my husband's plate which was barely accompanied by a child sized portion of vegetables. I'm sorry but when you are paying $35 for a meal....you expect your plate to be at least half full. I told my husband to say something but since it was my birthday he didn't want to make a scene. He did however ask to speak to the waitress when we were charged for food we didn't order. We informed her of the error and she at first tried to argue with us, and then said she would just take it off and \"take it out of her pay\". She returned with a new bill but instead of taking off 3 extra fried rice, she took off 2. We again said that we only ordered one and she said again \"she would just pay for it\". While waiting for our 2 corrected bill, we discovered that we not only paid 20% instead of 18% gratuity, but when she made the adjustment to the bill the gratuity never changed. At this point we asked the bus boy to speak to management, and to our dismay who comes out....the waitress. We asked the waitress to speak to management and she said she WAS the manager! She asked what the problem was and my husband began to tell her about the portion sizes and not even receiving the jasmine rice that was supposed to come with our $35 meal and then how the gratuity was never adjusted at which point she cut him off and said she would give it back to us (because at this point he just went ahead and paid). She continued to cut him off and kept smiling at him in which he said it doesn't seem like you even care. Her response \"I'm keeping a smile so I don't upset you\" At this point we were so disgusted we left.\n\nThe owner has very talented chefs who were very entertaining but needs to improve:\n-drink service\n-portion sizes\n-more servers\n-better management\n\nI would highly recommend you NOT waste your hard earned money to leave irritated, frustrated and still hungry.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LTyUyGdEvDsdpvxszrTZDw"}

We arrived around noon and the place wasn't too busy. We shared a large number of items from the menu.\n\nHere's a list of all everything we tried:\n\nGARLC KNOTS: Really good. Really small, but warm, flavorful and soft. \nRICE BALLS: These were just ok. I enjoyed them, but they weren't notable. \nLASAGNA EXPLOSIONS - I don't usually like lasagna, but this was a nice change of pace from typical lasagna. Moist and very cheesy.\nTRIPE - My favorite part of the meal. I don't typically enjoy tripe, but this preparation was very enjoyable. Not chewy at all and didn't have that tripe-y smell that usually turns me off.\nMEATBALLS & ITALIAN SAUSAGE - This dish was ok. The meatballs are huge, however, and I enjoyed the tomato sauce.  \nSEAFOOD PASTA IN GARLIC CREAM SAUCE - This dish was just ok. the sauce didn't have enough depth of flavor for me and I don't see myself ordering this dish again if I returned.\nSICILIAN PIZZA - I'm not usually a fan of deep dish. This had nice flavor, but it was a little doughy for my taste. Everyone else seemed to love this pizza, so it's just a matter of preference.\nWHITE PIZZA - This was one of the standouts. The pizza was seasoned and cooked well. I could have eaten just this dish and been happy. \nEGGPLANT PARM - I absolutely love eggplant, but this wasn't my favorite preparation. Too much breading and the eggplant was sliced a little too thinly for my taste. I do enjoy how they serve ziti instead of spaghetti with this dish, since I'm not a fan of spaghetti.\nZEPPOLES - These were my favorite of all the desserts served. I usually don't enjoy Italian desserts since they are a little denser than I prefer, so the zeppoles stood out for being a little more subtle and not overly sweet. Plus, I can never resist powdered sugar. \nRAINBOW CAKE - This was a little on the dry side for me. A little too chocolatey as well, but that's just a matter of preference.\nCANNOLI - I don't usually like cannolis and I can't say this one changed my mind about them. \nASSORTED COOKIES - These were good. They have a number of varieties and I would be back for more of these for sure. \n\nService was spectacular. Our drinks were kept full and everyone was extremely friendly and entertaining, making our meal that much more enjoyable. \n\nWe all had a great meal and there were plenty of leftovers for all. I was able to take some home to my mom who's a pasta fanatic and she loved it.

But judging from my last visit, the quality can  fluctuate. Given their vast menu, the dining experience can largely depend on the cook and what was ordered.**\n\nLast Tuesday was my third time back to Montesano's. I really love this place, it is so kitschy, friendly and small. I love the smell of this place. It reminds me of every cheesy Italian movie I've ever seen. I still say they have the best white pizza in town. Their crust is crispy perfection. They are generous with their delicious ricotta and the sweet sausage was flavorful, a great addition to the pie. They also sell it by the slice. I think I'll come by more often and order slices to go. \n\nThat being said, I ordered my other favorite dish, the Seafood Special in Garlic Cream sauce (it's not on the menu, you have to ask for it). Wow... it was not what I remembered. They still load down the huge plate with tasty, good-quality seafood. But there was a ton of sauce over it and not enough pasta, it was almost like eating cream of seafood. Sound gross... yeah, well.. the good quality seafood saved it from being a total disaster. The good thing was I took most of it home, added some more fettuccine, and I was able to get four meals out of it! That's how much sauce there was in the dish. And it wasn't a very good sauce, it was like the base to a flavorless clam chowder. \n\nThe bf ordered the lasagna and he liked it. I thought it was good. I do love the cheese they use and their tomato sauce is delicious, but a tad too salty. \n\nIn conclusion, I love their seafood and their pasta, but next time I'm going to try a different sauce, maybe their diavolo, which sounds divine. Their Garlic cream was excellent last time but after this visit, I don't know if I want to order it again. Their pizzas are fantastic, as are their bread and garlic knots. Wish I had room for dessert as they have an awesome selection of cookies and pastries out front.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XZWry6opFKs-BIwfpa_RWg"}

Much like the mythical beast for which it is named, this establishment almost defies description.\n\nFor starters, it isn't the easiest place to find, especially as the night grows later.  As you drive by on 7th Street - perhaps more than once - the lyrics from Tag Team will undoubtedly go through your mind (Whoomp!  There it is!) as you figure out how to turn around, how to get to the parking lot, which lot to park in, then how to get into the place.  Once you manage that, you are most of the way there.\n\nOnce inside, it is still a bit of a maze.  It's like you've stepped into another dimension, as this place seems much larger on the inside than the outside.  On one side is the karaoke.  Make sure you check it out if you can.  On the the other side is the game room.  Straight ahead is more of a bar area.  All around is a massive crowd.  Somewhere in the midst are the restrooms.\n\nAs to service?  Friendly and decent, if not especially quick.  Food?  Adequate bar food, but the only thing distinguishing here are the tator tots.  Check them out if you get a chance.  You may want to double up, but you get a good-sized order, so take it easy if you aren't sure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "z6GC2gdtR8IF-gtgErx1SA"}

Upon my aunt booking the reservation, they asked if we would be dining for a special occasion. Unbeknownst to me at the time, it was apparently their anniversary, and she happened to tell the hostess. When we were seated, the menu was personalized to read, \"Happy Anniversary X and X!\" It was pretty great.  And I really enjoyed not having to find parking in that area as they offer complimentary valet parking. Score!\n\nNow onto the food. Let's start with their in-house water bubbling system (those exist??). For $3.25 or $3.50, you can get unlimited sparkling water that has been bubbled on-site.  Apparently, it's a thing, but it's super cool, and I appreciated it.  Their bread was pretty average, but I found myself going after more pieces of bread than expected only because their dipping oil which is a combination of olive oil and pesto was absolutely phenomenal! Appetizers change with what's available/in season, but our party shared the Short Ribs, Halibut cheek, and antipasta, and we were more than satisfied.  Salads were nicely seasoned and dressed. Someone in my party got the \"cioppino\" which isn't much of a surprise since one would hope that a restaurant named after a dish would have perfected it, but I opted against that idea.  After a wonderful experience trying cioppino on the piers of San Francisco where it all really began, I opted for something else.  That something else was crab cakes and mac n' cheese. I have never had crab cakes quite as good as these before.  Truly.  Though Pittsburgh isn't really anywhere near the ocean, the crab was undeniably fresh. Places have a bad habit of over-seasoning crab cakes, but not Cioppino in Pittsburgh! It was seasoned just enough to add a little kick but it didn't overpower the natural flavor of the crab meat. And in a strange way, the cakes stayed together while also flaking apart perfectly. That mac n' cheese was pretty incredible, too with a light dusting of breadcrumbs! From what I hear, the halibut (main dish), lamb, lobster risotto, and cioppino eaten by others in my party were pretty great.  So great, that nothing remained on anyone's dishes.\n\nDessert was okay. It's one of two things that bring Cioppino's rating down from a 5 to a 4 for me. I got the molasses cake, and though it was tasty, it was nothing like what I expected based on its description on the menu. For some odd reason, it tasted very \"Guinness\"-ey to me. My cousin ordered two flavors of gelato and one ended up having to go back to the kitchen because it tasted as if the milk used had gone bad. We eventually received an apology from the kitchen and were told that the gelato flavor would be taken out of circulation - meaning there was something definitely wrong with it. Mu aunt and uncle shared the \"sampler\" and though the majority of the desserts on their platter were good, their version of chocolate covered bacon wasn't so scrumptious.  We all agreed after tasting it that it probably would have tasted better if they used milk instead of dark chocolate and if it was a room temperature chocolate as opposed to semi-solid/melted chocolate. \n\nMy last gripe about the place is their service. Food comes out SLOWLY. Our reservation was at 6, and by the time we actually left, it was almost 10pm. Four hours for dinner? Really? There were significant gaps between courses and it was a nightmare trying to get a hold of our server throughout the night. I was practically dancing in my seat trying to get his attention.  Don't get me wrong, when we finally had his attention, he was super attentive, but just trying to get it was quite the hassle. \n\nWould I return? Absolutely! Would I suggest this place to others? Of course! There a just a few kinks that they need to work out and that you, dear reader, need to be prepared for. Buon appetito!", "type": "review", "business_id": "AD0FE_5dM7pWy5YdbMZaGQ"}

I feel this is an outrageous amount of time and not one person apologized for taking so long to get my order ready.  I have had to wait in the past, but this time it was absolutely ridiculous!

I really don't know why I insist to challenge my gut feeling of \"don't order the fish taco's, your in the middle of the freakin desert, there is no ocean for hundreds of miles\", but no.. I had to order them.

And I wonder how long it's been since this place has gotten a good scrub, or at least a dusting???\n\nOK, our order was up, and we sat in the back on some picnic benches. It was hot, but they did have a huge fan that made it bearable to sit back there. We opened up our fish taco's and noticed, wow these are huge! They piled all sorts of stuff in there.. cabbage, rice, ton's of cheese, fish, some sort of secret sauce, all on a flour, kinda thick shell (taste like the mission brand). \n\nGrabbed the taco with both hands and bit into the taco. Blahhhh, it was the fish.. Oh man, the fish killed it.. taste so fishy and soggy it was gross. Next, don't ask me why I did it, but I thought I'd try it again. So I poured the red hot sauce they had given on it and tried it again.. Blahhhh, gross, gross, gross. The sauce didn't help at all. There sauce had no heat to it, and the fish was just as bad as the first bite. I had bought two taco's, and looked in back of me, and there were two guys in there 20's macking down on taco's, and I offered them our taco's we didn't eat. They said, no man.. where good. So I couldn't even give these away for free.. \n\nWe drove off grossed out, and I had this fishy taste in my mouth for about 20 minutes before I had to stop and get something else to eat to get the taste out. Soda wasn't doing the trick.

Bartender was a rude biddy, talking down to my husband because he made a mistake about their Craft Beer Week specials. \n2. Sat at a table at the bar and was not approached by any of the seemingly wandering waitstaff, so only had one beer when we would have ordered more.\n3. Father in law was wearing a hat like Curious George's keeper would wear, read, a fedora. An employee of the bar came to our table (at 10:05 pm) and told him that they have a dress code, so he would need to take it off. A., he's in his fifties, B., I don't recall ever hearing of a gang that uses fedoras as their identifier and C., give me a freaking break. It's MADISON WISCONSIN. \n4. Now for the best part of the evening: I attempted to leave through the back door that I had seen scores of people leaving through for the past hour we were in the bar. I was accosted by their bouncer, who was a roid-raging, shaved head asshole. Literally accosted- he grabbed me by my arm and tried to bodily yank me back through the door. I pulled away from him, and he then turned his blind rage on my husband, who had followed me not realizing what was happening. He grabbed my husband then, as I had made it outside to safety, twisted his arm behind him, threw him up against a wall, and started screaming in his face. He then threw my husband to the side to physically bar my, again, 50-something in-laws from leaving. I came back inside to call him on his roid rage, which he didn't like, because he had to be held back by his managers from coming after me to... not verbally assault me, surely, because he seemed to have the intellect of Kris Humphries, so I can only assume he was going to grab me again.\n\nWe tried to talk sense into the staff. It was like talking to a brick wall, so after a few choice words on my part, we left.\n\nThis place sucks. Avoid it. Hope they fired that dickhead bouncer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Mk3Zdgr98L5aX8OZbamLUg"}

My wife and I arrived a bit early to check out their bar and to have a cocktail.  The inside and outside of the bar has a great vibe.  Between the relaxed upscale atmosphere, great martinis (with blue cheese olives of course), friendly bar tenders, and the bowls of snacks; I could have sat there all night.  However, I was on a mission to eat an awesome steak so I had to press on....\n\nHere are the highlights because just about everything to say has already been said on here:\n\n* Popover - WOW! Light, airy, chewey perfection.  The butter and sea salt was a nice touch.\n* Tuna Tartar - very good \n* Caesar Salad - excellent and enough to share \n* Ribeye - this was probably the best ribeye I've ever had.  It was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and wasn't too fatty.\n\nThe only negatives of this place are the sides.  They are small, over-priced for their size, and not memorable at all.  Next time I'm going to try the french fries and/or the mashed potatoes.\n\n* Gnocchi - the gnocchi themselves were excellent, but the sauce was just eh.  It was just a regular pasta sauce it seemed like\n* Maccaroni - not good at all.  They used weird cheese and big pieces of ham or something.\n* Potato Gratin  - just eh\n* Carrots and Asparagus -  these 2 sides were very good and I would order them again. \n\nThe 2 desserts the table sampled were equally as \"eh\" as the sides.\n\nAnyway, the steak was fabulous and I want to return for it.  The service was equally as good as our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RRGRruNX4o6689EB48z3-A"}

I recommend the mojito very good and just the right mix of tart and freshness.  \n\nFor light bites I had the Duck Pate with wine mustard which was very good.  It had some nice earthy flavor that the wine mustard really played well with.  I then got the steak tartar which was just phenomenal.

Before, I used to only like burittos from Chipotle (I tried La Hacienda, Pasqualis, and other places around the city, but I was never impressed). Taquerias Guadalajara, however, is the best place I have ever eaten, ever (my husband agrees, and he tried different mexican joints around the country).It's so good it makes me want to go to Mexico and explore more about their foods and cultures.. \n\nMy favourite: Chicharrones gorditas and pork steak tacos (I usually have two tacos and one gorditas for only 5.75 before tax.

I knew the minute that the calamari arrived that this would be a negative experience. It was over-cooked, obviously of the frozen bagged variety, served with mae ploy. We were brought some fresh lemons which did help. The service wasn't terrible, but I was called \"honey\" all night long by someone about my age.\n\nWe ordered the Arizona roll, Spicy Tuna roll, Eel Tempura roll, Rainbow roll, and the Sex on the Beach roll. All of which had too much rice, to little seasoning, and low quality ingredients.\n\nThe worst was the Eel tempura. It tasted burnt, like it had been fried in bad oil. The Rainbow was next up, warm, disgusting so that we didn't eat it. The Sex on the beach (spicy with raw scallops and siracha), wasn't so bad, because I love spicy food. It was spicy enough that you couldn't taste the poor ingredients. The other two were just nasty-too much imitation crab, too much cream cheese, too much old cucumber, and warm, gelatinous looking fish. GROSS.\n\nWe like to sit at the sushi bar and it was so low and small- obviously so you can't see what the sushi chef is using for your rolls! Not the best ambiance. \n\nSave yourself time and money. Don't be fooled by their tempting \"discounts\"- $10 a roll (after 30% off)  is outrageous for the quality.\n\nI can't comment on the drinks because we stuck to water. They don't have Saturday drink specials.\n\nI will stick to my old standbys Kyoto or Sakana. Cheap, fast, and more delicious than any sushi I've had in the Phoenix area.

I'm vegetarian, so he busted out laughing when I emphatically said, \"This is the BEST broccoli I've ever had!\" It honestly was, though (Broccoli au Gratin).

Despite it being fresh out of the oven (and therefore burning hot), it was gone in the first 5 minutes and I'd kill to have it again. Green beans and mashed potatoes were beyond perfect as well, and my fiance seemed infatuated with his filet. It was brought out a little less than medium at first, but the sizzling plate finished that job as he continued eating. At the end of the night, they sent us off with the complimentary chocolate cheesecake. I ate it the next day- it was deeeeelish!\n\nDom was our server for the night and he was everything a restaurant waiter should be- visible and accommodating, but not overbearing. He was professional, he came up at the right times without being obnoxious, and whenever our conversation paused, I noticed that he was always nearby and he would have been easily accessible if we ever had ever found that we needed his attention (even though we didn't). \n\nIt was a great night out and I'd love to do it again. But of course, don't go if you're not willing to spend some money. It was over $80 (before a tip) for two glasses of wine, a vegetable plate and the filet. But it was WELL worth it.

I've tried and tried to find \"good\" Sonoran style Mexican food and am always disappointed by a greasy mess, up until I stumbled upon ATS.  \n\nThe people that work here are very sweet and the decor is charming.  I would describe it as a kind of surf shop meets diner decor.  It is in a cute older house on 7th, well maintained and colorfully adorned with artsy knickknacks and brickabrack and such.\n\nThe food is very cheap and very simple, you can tell that love goes into every dish.  A bean burrito is $3.25 and very filling.  The been and cheese concoction that fills it is very tasty but not overly greasy, much unlike many of the other lauded burrito places in town.  The veggie quesadilla was delicious as well, kind of crunchy from the cabbage or something that is inside.  Both were served with some traditional accoutrement and homemade, wonderful salsa.  \n\nThe jewel of my meal here was the white corn on the cob.  Not really knowing what I was ordering at first, I was a little doubtful, but really wanted something more veggie like to round out the meal.  What came was the most wonderful ear of corn I have ever eaten.  The cob is a sweet white corn which is then slathered in a slim coat of mayo and dipped in what I think was parmesean cheese (but was probably the Sonoran equivalent).  This was served with lime and a chili sauce that was sweet and spicy and out of this world when doused on the corn.\n\nWhat a great little place in a wonderful neighborhood (maybe my favorite) of central Phoenix.  If you feel let down by the Mexican food that has covered this valley in a layer of tasteless grease, go here before giving up (also go to Mucho Gusto in Tempe, ATS is the cheaper option).", "type": "review", "business_id": "3l72FflaaeI0tWEAWN3-gQ"}

Local artist's canvases hanging all over, beautiful interior (I think it was an old Starbucks) and a bookshelf full of everything. After 5  years, I picked up a Terry Pratchett and started leafing through it. The laid back vibe and the friendly surroundings make it so unique in a city like Las Vegas.  The decor is modern and every couch/table set was different...I spotted a couple of Ikea pieces (I'm an Ikea junkie like that) and there were some accent chairs...everything looked so cosy and comfortable and most importantly LOCALLY UNIQUE.\n\nI ordered a small hazelnut latte...yummilicious...I didn't have to add anything to it...the waitress hand-delivered it to me. To eat, I ordered a breakfast croissant sandwich sans egg. It came with spinach leaves, avocado, cream cheese, slice of what seemed like provolone and tomatoes. Just the right, clean food for a good start to the day. It was delicious (never thought that such simple food would give me so much joy). The coffee and tea menu here is extensive and everything seems so well-thought of. They have a few burritos/sandwiches (all of which could be customized). I think I may hang here everyday. \n\nThe staff was hilarious...they whipped up my drink and food, served it to me at my table and they were so sweet. While I was eating, I heard their conversation behind the counter. Man, were they HILARIOUS....I can't really repeat what they were talking about due to the whole PC thing but let's say they had some very interesting and funny things to say. I loved these guys. Apparently, they have a drive through to...but I'm gonna stick with coming in since I love this place so much. \n\nHonestly, they could have served me a dog biscuit and I would have still been in love with the place just because it's such a local gem.

I was not about to drive back, wait for another plate to get cooked, then drive back home to eat, (not to mention my other plate getting cold while I go out and do all of this) so I figured just call and they could credit my card back or give me another replacement plate another day.  \n\nTheir response:\n1- come back on the same day and they will make me another plate\nOR\n2- come back another day for a 10% discount\n\nREALLY?  \nIf I don't want to drive back the same day for YOUR mistake ALL you're going to do for me and my plate of food with HAIR is to give me a 10% discount on whatever I decide to spend more of my money on for an additional plate?  So I lose my money on my first plate for apparent reasons, then I CAN spend another $8-$9 minus 10%??  Horrible customer service and bad judgement on managements part.\n\nP.S.\nI tried their \"Salt and Pepper Pork Chops\" and they should more accurately call it Salt and Pepper Batter Balls with slivers of pork and bones.  There were about 3 pieces that tasted like actual pork chops and the rest of it were balls of deep fried batter with little bitty bones.  I've had this dish at numerous chinese restaurants around Las Vegas like Joyful House who nail it, sadly Ohana missed the mark on this dish.  I'd hate to taste their General Tso's chicken/Orange chicken dishes with the same batter balls and bitty pieces of meat...never on my penny.\n\nNeedless to say they can take that 10% discount (what a joke for having HAIR in their dish) and give it to someone else, I'm never going back.\n\nGo to L&L Barbeque, Island Sushi, Rice Trax, or Island Flavor for good Hawaiian Style plate lunches.  If you want chinese go someplace in Chinatown (Asian BBQ & Noodles, Joyful House), Hawaiian Chinese style at Diamond China or Wo Fat. \n\nSave your money and stay away from this place, too many good options out there for you with better service and better food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C0r1yj7CBKMXc4Up_5Nmhg"}

She probably won't.  She'll probably finish her degree in architecture and go on to design green buildings.  Which is sort of a shame, because if she followed this dream, there would be more places like Dinette, and that'd be a good thing.\n\nDinette does one thing (Neapolitan pizza + fresh ingredients) and does it really really well.  You won't find ground breaking pairings of ingredients, but honestly, I don't think you can really improve on prosciutto + arugula or squash + sage.  (This part of Penn Circle has really become a hotspot for Pittsburgh dining in the last few years, every time Belle and I were going to one of the nearby places without a reservation, she would \"hint\" that if the wait was too long, we could go to Dinette and see if the squash and sage pie was on the menu)  One of Dinette's strengths is knowing when discipline and restraint are called for.  It's pizza, good antipasto, and maybe 4 other items from cooking school.  If you don't like thin crust pizza, Dinette isn't for you.  If you want a generic pepperoni and mushroom, Dinette isn't for you.  Otherwise, go for it.\n\nAnother positive sign is that one of Dinette's early weaknesses, an uneven wine selection, has been addressed and is becoming a strength.  Specialty restaurants only have so many ways that they can distinguish themselves from one another.  Dinette's selection of wines by the glass is one and its decor (a take on mod Scandinavian) is another.

She had been there once before, but this was the first visit for the rest of us.  I had trepidations from reading so many comments about how \"formal\" it was, and how it was not good for children.  Both of those comments could not be farther from what we experienced!\n\nWhen I made reservations online, I clearly indicated that we would have two young children, maybe just to see if the restaurant would give some indication of their reaction...but within 10 minutes, I got a phone call to confirm the request and welcoming our children to dine with us.  At that time, I also mentioned that it was my wife's birthday, and they graciously said they would \"do something\" as a surprise.  Yes, I know this is becoming perhaps an all-too-familiar 'perk' for restaurants as well as many diners (to have to hear Happy Birthday chanted several times during their meal!).\n\nThe decor is upscale and suggests the kind of place with some snoot appeal, where people may come to be seen, but let's face it, this is a suburban restaurant, and what restaurant would risk alienating the down-to-earth folks with an overly haughty attitude these days?  Via Brasil gets it just right in that the 'hardware' is upscale and formal, but the staff and service is engaging and friendly, without any pretentiousness whatsoever.\n\nWhen we arrived, I immediately noticed many parties with children...although I couldn't help but note that they all seemed to be seated in the front section of the restaurant, and that maybe the staff was consciously trying to keep the back part of the large open dining area somewhat kid-free and quiet.  It didn't matter to us - the entire dining room is beautiful, and the food is the same regardless of what GPS cell your table is in!\n\nAs for the food, I rated it 4 stars and not 5 just because there were some items that were not quite as superlative as others.  Everything happened as others have mentioned:  you sit for a short while, order drinks, and build up a little more anticipation, but then it's a bee-line to the buffet, which had more variety than the average casino/hotel buffet.  Salads, soups, and various hot dishes (stroganoff, a curry dish, a risotto, seafood paella, etc.), along with appetizers that were presented well and tasted great (carpaccio, asparagus,  etc.).  NOTE:  The captain had come over shortly after we were seated to let me know that our 9-year old would be given a very reduced price for the entire meal (around $15, I think), and she would be able to eat anything she wanted (all meats, etc.), and that our 6-year old would not be charged at all.  While I don't know if that's their standard policy, I felt that was more than fair, and certainly goes a long way to encourage \"family dining\" at this restaurant from time to time.  The waitstaff was great in handling our children, too, always stopping at each one of them to see if they, too, wanted to try whatever cut of meat they were offering on each round.\n\nEven as we were coming back with full plates of appetizers, freshly grilled meats were being 'walked' around the tables, and the noshing (if one can 'nosh' on meats!) started right away.  Before we knew what hit us, we had cuts and slices of so many different types of meats...and most of it was excellent.  All of the beef offerings (rib eye, picanha, flank steak, garlic picanha, and the prime rib; we passed on the ribs because they were too huge and wouldn't fit on our plates at the time) were fantastic.  My wife enjoyed the lamb chops immensely, though I wish we had stuck around for the leg of lamb to make its rounds.  The other offerings - turkey, pork, and salmon - were a little hit-or-miss, probably because I prefer my meats less 'garnished', and these were typically crusted or sprinkled with parmesan or wrapped in bacon.  Actually, I enjoyed the salmon, though many may find its smoked flavoring a little washed out and bland, and its texture a little pasty instead of flaky (imagine cooked small roe!).  The sausage didn't do anything for me...but then again, I'm not a sausage fan.\n\nBefore we knew it, almost 2 hours had elapsed, which is saying a lot when dining with 2 children!  They had sampled quite a few meats, too, and while it may not become their favorite restaurant, I think the \"bigness\" of the experience kept them from becoming restless, and they both said they enjoyed VBS.\n\nI'm running out of room here..so I'll just say LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  They also remembered my quick comment about my wife's birthday, and delivered birthday wishes as requested!  Definitely a place to consider for all occasions, but do plan on spending a good deal of time and money (around $150 for the entire experience, even with the generous discounts for the kids, and we aren't wine drinkers).  I hope this place stays around a while!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "V7-f6dE87cNga5dSJ4CuZw"}

Its gleaming bright white is festooned with paisley-like cut-outs to give oh-so-subtle silhouette patterns from floor to ceiling (see photos). If you ask me, it's a little too white, sort of like a scene from George Lucas' \"THX 1138\" (sorry for the geek sci-fi reference). The only real color comes courtesy of the thousands of goldfish inhabiting the oblong tanks along the entryway. It's quite a sight since you're never quite sure if they are there for decoration or as a potential appetizer. \n\nYet, even when you're seated, the white-on-white decor makes you feel like everyone is staring and your fly is open. Jamie W. and I quickly buried our heads into the menus. We decided to share two dishes, both extravagantly priced - the $20.09 Steamed Scallops and Vermicelli with Garlic and the $16.09 Braised Pork with Rice Noodle Beijing Style (see photos). Note the artificial use of the number 9 in their prices to reflect their name. Anyway, when the dishes came out, we were both startled at how decidedly mediocre they looked and tasted. It was like watching a supermodel wearing a stunning outfit only to discover she was wearing dirty panties underneath. \n\nThe scallops were not terrible, just paltry (only six served) and bland with an incompatible pile of transparent pasta underneath. The braised beef dish, however, was deplorable. Whether the noodles were homemade or not, they looked like the kind of thick chow mein you would get at a bad suburban take-out joint. Again, the meat portion was paltry, and there was nothing to indicate it had been braised more than sitting in a wok for far too long. Not only the food was disappointing, but the service was surly and the hostess had attitude. Perhaps there were too many high-rollers who didn't leave tips. \n\nFOOD - 2 stars...mediocre and pricey, a deadly combination \nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...like I said, pretty white-on-white decor with lots of goldfish \nSERVICE - 2 stars...why the sour face? \nTOTAL - 2 stars...take a pass and go to Noodles in the Bellagio...better food with a smile", "type": "review", "business_id": "bCRrLdBLel3y73tA8w6C3Q"}

I was impressed in a lot of ways.\n\nFor starters, from the outside, the place looks like a nice little hole in the wall/mom and pop type of place. But when I opened the door and walked in, I had to do a double take. It's kind of like that one closet from that Narnia movie. Yeah, that closet. \n\nSo I am directed by one of the many servers to any table that's available. The menu's are all ready to go on all the tables. What a concept. You come in, grab any available table, go over the menu, order, eat, and you're out. These guys definitely got a system down. I would say I was helped out by at least 3 different servers. That's why their service is very good. They are constantly running around. \n\nAs for the food, I noticed a lot of good choices. But that day, I was really hungry and I was not gonna settle just for any burger. No sir. So I got their biggest burger called Mama's Burger. Damn. This was a case of my eyes being hungrier than my stomach. Two half pound patties, slices of avocado, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, cheese, and an onion ring. At first glance, I didn't know how to attack it. I kid you not, I was rotating my plate just looking for a chink in the armor. In the end, I ended up trying to smash it down with the palm of my hand in hopes of getting it down to the size of my mouth. Needless to say, I could only eat half of it. At that point I felt like running away crying to Mr. Mama himself (or is it herself? I don't wanna assume anything you know?). Ok, so I had dinner covered.\n\nThe only thing that might be a disappointment is their hours. 6 am to 3 pm. What if I wanna redeem myself for that burger and it just happens to be dinner time? *flashback to that lunch moment* Ok, I take it back, that's not really a disappointment.\n\nSo, umm, yeah go check this place out.

While the cajun ones were all right, we all preferred the BBQ sauce variety.  I've had better tasting seitan, but that BBQ sauce was good.  Blue cheese and ranch dressing on the side didn't hurt, either.  The wings also come with some celery and carrot sticks, and toasted pita triangles.\n\nAs my entree, I had the Urban Velo burger with a vegetarian patty and without bacon.  If you like a spicy burger, this is pretty good.  I also liked that the veggie burger had that char-grilled taste, which not all restaurants do with their meatless patty.  Two of my friends tried the burgers with peanut butter, and were really happy with their decisions.\n\nMy nut brown ale was fine, but my friends were raving about their espresso beers.  And everyone was pleased with the $3 price during Happy Hour.  Between the beers, the appetizers and the burgers, we got really full fast.\n\nIt got harder to catch our waitress' attention the later we stayed, so we ended up not getting as many drinks as we might have.  If you took advantage of happy hour specials, be sure to check that your bill reflects the specials--our initial bill didn't and we had to ask our waitress.  The place was busy because there was a game on, and she did apologize and correct it, but it's still best to stay on your toes.\n\nNext time, it's you and me, PB burger.

That's like going to a sushi restaurant and paying for soy sauce or a burger place and paying for ketchup. The cheese actually on the menu as a side. Are you kidding me? We're not talking special grated cheese. It looked like the stuff from a green shaker bottle. I wanted to add some salt to our appetizer, but there was none on the table.

Who ever says that Kaya deserves more than 1 star must be out of their minds! Or haven't had the chance to have REAL FRESH sushi! Rolls does not count as real sushi by the way. Nigiri Sushi is served fresh and raw.  Besides when you go to a Sushi restaurant, wouldn't you want to try the Nigiri first to ensure that fish quality is fresh before you order the rolls? I mean, the sushi rolls would be hard to tell if the fish is fresh. Rolls are a concoction of mixed ingredients rolled up with fish and rice. \n\nSo, here are my critiques of Kaya's AYCE sushi:\n\nDepressing!! Fish quality is so poor that we enjoyed eating the overloaded rice more. Nigiri sushi is supposed to be fresh, melting in your mouth at each taste. Yellow tail, salmon, white tuna and all of the other fish that we courageously ordered are not suppose to taste the same! Kaya's fish leaves an everlasting taste of sourness in your mouth.\n\nAppetizers were not bad.\n\nThe Skewers is definitely NOT the art of Robatta grill that Japanese tradition takes pride of. No why wonder they called it skewers on the menu and not Yakitori!\n\nWe gave it a another chance and ordered the Kaya roll. Perhaps, thinking we can leave saying that one item was actually good.  Kaya roll was welted! I mean, you can tell by the thinly sliced green onion that was crinkly and trying to hide the stale fish with the rest of the concoction. \n\nWe ordered green tea ice cream for dessert. We took one bite and instantly it had a floral taste in our mouths, as if we were eating cold air freshener! \n\nI am sorry fellow yelpers, but Kaya is not a hidden gem nor fresh sushi! Perhaps, our fellow yelper Natalie L. can agree to this! The after taste in my mouth is so bad that I had to eat a snicker bar to satisfy my horrible lunch!!\n\nP.S.\nI cannot stress the fact that Xtreme Sushi is the best AYCE sushi in town for the price and fish quality!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZxmKA8b7njab1DNzCEU4Ow"}

My issue was that as they were setting up, literally around our table, we felt rushed and in the way.  I get that they were busy and excited about their event, but If they needed the space, they should have closed that section off.  They were decorating and rushing around, all around our table, and no one even acknowledged us or said anything to us.  It was only the older man, who I assumed to be the owner who smiled at us and waved to our kids as we were leaving and thanked us for coming in.  Thank goodness for that nice, simple gesture to help smooth things over.", "type": "review", "business_id": "v0UcWfHvGgYZYFobaSOr8A"}

A group of us swung by during June's First Friday around 830PM. We were seated relatively fast and our orders were taken in short order, but after that service came to a grinding halt. The menu is limited in general but the sandwiches looked great, of course that was not what I ordered. I went for the $5 gypsy stew which was really tasty, but I was served a portion that should have cost $1.25. I mean seriously, soup is the classic poor people food, this had like 16 garbanzos, a few random veggies floating around in it and a little bit of potato. For $5 I could have made at least a gallon of soup. Please at least serve a portion that isn't blatant about ripping me off. Thank you. Because I'd gone light on dinner I ordered the olive oil cake thing I'd seen at the register with a tag on it that said $2.50 a slice. The cake came out with a side of 4 cantaloupe cubes and 1 strawberry in some glaze. The cake was nice, pretty much the consistency of corn bread and no heavy olive flavor. I'd never had it before so weee, new things in my mouth.  When it came time to pay my $2.50 slice of cake morphed into a $5.50 dessert. Say what? \n\nI am infinitely annoyed by price gouging and none of this food is spectacularly intricate or worth the wait. When I tell you that we waited 30 minutes for 4 sandwiches and 1 cup of soup I am not speaking in hyperbole. We didn't leave sapna until 10PM because the server forgot to serve me the cake slice i'd ordered at the same time as the soup.  \n\nYeah I guess I'm a little bitter about it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QPheu9dnwdlaPwXofP8ijw"}

My bro-in-law had the house salad and the wasabi seared ahi.  He's from Hawaii, too, and enjoyed the fresh ahi after scraping off the wasabi-flavored crust.  I tried it and found it very much lacking in seasoning, it was way too thick of a dry crust, and there was no sauce so we had to doctor it up with some soy sauce.

I still had my room at Planet Hollywood and it was dinner time and I was starving.  I was going to be eating by myself, something that I usually don't enjoy doing so I tried to be good and quell my hunger with a fabulously healthy and nutritious Strawberry Whirl (with Immunity boost.. god I don't want to get this flu!) which I got inside the millennium mall next door.  I was restless and alone and needed some fresh air so I took a walk outside in the cold air with my cold drink around the corner to see what was going on at Krave.  Krave is gone.  It closed in October of last year and will be opening downtown in a few months or so the nice valet for the tony looking Italian restaurant that abuts the former Krave location informed me.  I headed back around the corner into the bright lights of the strip.  My Jamba Juice cup was empty.  My hunger was coming back full force.  I felt light headed and in need of comfort.  \n\nI headed into PF Chang's and got a seat at the bar and ordered a Sapporo and some Sesame chicken and struck up a conversation with my neighbors at the bar who were drinking saki and having a good time.  The vibe was great here.  Tony, my server, gave me excellent quick  friendly up beat service.  After I was warmed up a bit with my food and friendly surroundings two beefy cowboys from Houston took the seats on the other side of me at the bar.  They ended up drinking saki too and we had a great time talking and I didn't feel like I was eating or drinking alone any more.   My other neighbors left, and needless to say my cowboy neighbors corrupted me into ordering saki as well and I dragged my meal out for a few hours just drinking and talking with them.  They seemed to appreciate my company as much as I did theirs, but when 10PM rolled around I had to pull myself away and get my luggage from my room (just steps away upstairs at PH) and jump in a cab to the airport.  I did get their numbers though.\n\nThanks, PF Changs for delivering consistent good food and friendly service.  Wether it's Bentonville AK, Tyson's Corner VA, or even the strip in Las Vegas, NV.  You guys deliver and provide a nice atmosphere conducive to a relaxed good time.\n\nFYI.. The Large Saki I ordered was only $6.50 and packed a punch and I don't even think it was happy hour at the time since it was well after 8PM.. what a value!", "type": "review", "business_id": "GmAGA39Wjv3MLT2ju5ALQQ"}

We also had our standard mix of garlic and plain naan which we love to use the mop up all the lovely rich creamy gravy that you usually associate with Indian food and these dishes in particular.\n\nWhat arrived was not rich, creamy or even remotely lovely. They seem to take the \"healthy take on Indian food\" to extremes here. My tikka masala looked like it had been prepared by throwing a few pieces of chicken tikka into a mixture of blended onion, tomato, green peppers, and cilantro which had then been cut with about a cup of water until watery and tasteless. We heard the microwave going during the preparation, so I'd say that's pretty much exactly what was happening.\n\nImagine what you'd get if you microwaved a can of (if it existed) \"Progresso low fat, low sodium Indian curry chicken soup\". There's something extremely wrong with your Chicken Tikka Masala when no matter how many times you re-dip your chicken in the \"sauce\" it comes up completely devoid of anything covering it. The chicken itself was bland, waterlogged and soaked free of any flavour whatsoever.\n\nWe didn't really have much use for our naan since there was no real gravy here, but my garlic naan was pretty tasteless.\n\nThe only minor saving grace of the meal was the excellent home made lemonade and the passable samosas we began our meal with. \n\nTo round things all off, a bill of close to $50 for a terrible meal in a restaurant that felt like a Subway landed on the table and I knew the second star I was going to award this place just for the lemonade and friendly service was gone.  \n\nIf you're a health fanatic who likes vaguely chili flavoured water with your chicken, paneer etc, then this place might be for you.

Darn it!\n\nNext time will stick to the basics & get the Rice, Beans, & Cheese\n\n'Cause, yeah, we'd probably go back if found in the same situation & not lucky enough to be flying out of the Virgin Terminal - where all the tasty fast food options are located", "type": "review", "business_id": "1dnarzaw3bwFrK38hldi_Q"}

We all shared plates because they were too big for us: chicken pasta alfredo with foccacia bread, thai beef salad, chicken fingers, and a huge omelet with sweet potato fries. \n\nThe pasta was a little heavy but delicious! It was a perfect meal for after clubbing. I enjoyed the thai beef salad because there were a variety of different flavors that blended perfectly. There were also different textures (bits of crispy noodles, coconut shaving, and tender beef) that were a great mix together. \n\nTo top off the night, we shared the frrrozen hot chocolate. It hit our chocolate craving spot so we loved it. Since it was our friend's birthday, we told our wonderful waitress and she and her other coworkers sang to our friend and brought out another frozen hot chocolate. \n\nThe service was pretty good, especially since there were a lot of people there.

I did have the Fried Oreo Cookie Sundae which is just about one of the best dessert's I've eaten from a restaurant.  They don't do the classic County Fair fried oreo... Here they \"bread it\" with Corn Flakes and when it melts the ice cream a little... its like dunking your oreo cookie in milk when you are eating it together with the ice cream.  \n\nMy wife has always been a fan of the frooozen hot chocolate and now they have many different flavors.  I think we ended up with the classic one for everyone to try.  We had gotten the apple cobbler ala mode also to share with the group and it was a pleasant change to the other dishes being that it didn't feel like a complete sugar overload.

Let me just set the record straight.  I had ABSOLUTELY NO, ZERO, ZIP, NADA interest in eating here due to my total reliance upon my fellow Yelpers POV...until my Boss, who is a Foodie, invited me to have lunch with him.  \n\nHonestly, when he asked, I had thoughts of Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, Bradley Ogden, or even the Munch Bar, but he said \"Trip S\".  Out of respect for those readers with more conservative morals, I will refrain from what truly emanated from my under my breath, but let's just say I would not normally use this kind of language but sometimes the autonomic response elicits more idiomatic expressions you would typically follow up with an immediate \"Sorry!\"\n\nOkay, with that loquacious preamble let me speak to the BEST !$#@%!$^%$# thing I've ate so far in 2011!!!  Whoa man!  I ordered the Las Vegas Strip Sandwich (pics 9 and 11).  10 ounces of prime medium rare NY Strip beef on a toasted French roll around 18 inches long; slathered with garlic butter, covered with three over easy eggs and six crisscrossed thick cut smoky, sweet, salty, crispy bacon.  BACON!!! \n\nLet's back up minute.  When we arrived at \"Trip S\" it was packed. The very nice hostess with the great smile sat us at the one of the two available seats.  Our Server, another lady with an easy manner and great smile, got us drinks immediately...well, within 2 minutes anyway and she followed up with us a few minutes later to let us know that our food was coming eminently.  I noticed other guests were signaling for her attention and she seemed to have a very good awareness of her area and appeared to notice the polite hand waving in her periphery without losing connection with us.  Once she was done with us, she moved on to the neighboring guests, flashed her award winning great smile and they were putty in her hands.  Actually, she had me at \"Hello\".\n\nThe food arrives!!!  First my Boss's Ruben arrives.  I love a good Ruben and when I saw his, I thought I should have ordered one, but didn't want to make anyone uncomfortable.  You know what I mean...next, my Las Vegas Strip Sandwich arrives and WHOA MAN, I am so glad I didn't get the Ruben now...next visit.   This is a hefty piece of carnivores delight.   If I were at home I would have thrown it on a plate, plop down on the couch, put on some football and gone to town, but being in coat and tie and in public that whole egg yolk dribbling down the chin would not fly so I did the right thing and cut it into thirds.  About a pound each I swear to goodness.  I took the first bite...how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...It was almost as good a lingering first kiss.  Hot, salty, crunchy, savory, smoky, my ...WAIT! BACK THE TRUCK UP!!!!...that is not a good example of a great lingering first kiss, but just work with me.  The synchronization of flavors, textures, body responses, was almost overwhelming.  Yes, I was totally satisfied.  \n\nPlease note that this sandwich is not for the faint of heart.  You need to get your grub on to finish it but alas, that how I roll.  It's just one of those things you want to continue masticating until it's no more no matter how full the hypothalamus screams. \n\nBon appetite!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ"}

When we put our name down with the hostess we were told a 30 minute minute wait. We received a text message within about 10 minutes that the table was ready! Sweet!! \nThe waiter was fast, and friendly. He didn't really do a whole lot of chit chat which I am perfectly okay with! \n\nFOOD: EXCELLENT!! \nI ordered the Ahi Tuna salad. This was so refreshing!! The tuna was superb, and the avocado was just the right texture! I could not finish the salad because the portion was huge which is why I think the 17 dollar price tag was fair and the tuna was so good! \n\nMy husband ordered the ABC burger. It comes with avocado, brie cheese and caramelized onions. I watched him cut it down the middle and the cheese was melted on there just the right way! It looked really delicious and came with sweet potato fries. He really enjoyed his meal.\n\nWe also ordered a frozen hot chocolate of course.. peanut butter cup flavor. It was 11 dollars so high, but worth it! We did not order alcohol. In fact, you really should only order alcohol in a Casino because anywhere else in Vegas you go there is a 500 percent mark up!! But we really are not drinkers and it was way too hot that weekend!! \n\nATMOSPHERE: The decor is super cool in Serendipity 3, and I love the look of the menu! The dishes were pretty neat! You have great views all around you. With the Flamingo right across so you can see the Vegas lights and then on the other side you can see Caesar's Palace and there is a little courtyard area with a bar in the middle. I personally feel like one of the best parts about Vegas is all the people watching. If you sit near the courtyard section of the restaurant you can see a ton of people walking by! \n\nIf you are like us and not necessarily poor but Craft Steakhouse is not an option,  this is a really decent restaurant where you can spend roughly 50 bucks for 2 people.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ"}

I Could not let this self proclaimed BBQ snob enjoy all the saucy goodness all alone so I ordered the Ribs and Brisket combo with the mac and cheese and potatoes... \n\nThe waiter brought out the plate and to the eye I was impressed, it looked juicy, tasty and everything a BBQ snob hopeful could ask for. I pulled a rib off the half rack and raised it to my mouth......... Now that you are waiting for some crazy descriptive to tell you how delicious it was take a moment to enter your own word here............... Okay that's enough of that, its my turn, It was Crap, somehow the rib pulled off the half rack but maybe in the 2 foot travel to my mouth it got jet lag or something because it was dull, dry and unexciting. I was in no way impressed and was doubting the BBQ snobs credentials. \n\nI then figured, \" well I need to be fair, and try the brisket,\" It had that nice brisket look with the pink rim and cooked center so i grabbed my fork and went at it. Hoping to reignite my passion to be on the BBQ snob wagon I tore into it and low and behold I had the same crappy experience, it was dry and had a rather odd taste for brisket. If I could have made a BBQ Snobs citizens arrest or revoked his snob certificate I would have. \n\nThe server was great, he kept my drink full and checked in on us just enough to be very attentive and not a creeper.

When you think something is $2.95, you probably think it is either a small portion, not good or both of these things.  Well it is neither of these things.  The appetizers are generous portions and great tasting with several selections to choose from.  I want to just make it easy and say to the waiter, I'll have one of each please.  I love a good cheeseburger and the Brio Bistecca Burger is definitely my favorite right now.  It comes on a tasty bun with mozzarella cheese and is served with well done potato chips...yum!  You don't even get messy eating it because they cut it into quarters for you.  The bruschetta is also easy to eat because you can just pick it up and bite it.  They have two different kinds on the happy hour menu.  Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta with fresh basil and a balsamic drizzle and Sliced Steak Brushetta with Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and Tuscan Italian dressing.  There is also a Margherita Flatbread that is prepared with Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil cooked in an authentic Italian wood-burning oven.  I don't eat calamari but my friends ordered the Calamari Fritto Misto which was fried to a crisp golden brown with peperoncini and they liked it.  This is probably just either half or less than half of what they offer for $2.95.  I still haven't tried either shrimp appetizers or the eggplant appetizer.  The Beef Carpaccio served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and fresh Parmesan cheese looks excellent as well.  Tuscan culinary creations are perfected at Brio.

I have to admit, what I was craving was nowhere close to where we ended up with but both Sara and I have always wanted to try out the Parlor after hearing so many good things about it that we finally did it and I am glad! whew! \n\nSo, first impressions - It's a Wednesday night, parking lot is full which is always a good sign, the entrance with the fireplace facing the patio, and the smell of pizza wafting from the kitchen sets up a good evening for dining out. The host staff were quite friendly (no attitudes there *yay*), and the chalk board on the wall with their daily specials looked good. I have to say that the overall interiors of this place is so comfy, yet spacey... I just love it! \n\nI ordered a blueberry shake because I saw it as one of their fruit specials of the day plus I read somewhere that it's good for men's health and I also needed my calcium too! And we also ordered the frito misto which I agree with others was not that great... it was good but the portion was too small but just right for two persons. So, Sara and I were deciding on what pizzas we'd get to share, so we settled on the Yukon Gold Potato and the Salsiccia. \n\nBetween the two pizzas we shared... I totally loved the Yukon... it was just yummy!!! loved the potato and the Gorgonzola and the leeks mmmmmmm! The Salsiccia was good, the sausage was yum but the radish totally screwed with your taste buds. It had a bitter taste that totally reminded me of arugula but nonetheless it was good. Loved the crust... it was crisp and loved the toasted burnt taste. So here we were satisfied with our pizza selections, enjoyed the attentive service of our many servers, took in the atmosphere of the place, and I kept on eyeing the dolci people were ordering around us. I know I know I should have ordered the Tiramisu but when your server tells you that they have an in-house pastry chef and sells the apple crostada and mentions her other favorite is the chocolate cake, one's reaction would be is to listen to the recommendation and go for the apple crostada. SO we did, we gave in and got ourselves the crostada. I will liken this review to a potential break up scene in which a couple goes on a date and everything seems fine and well until the guy or girl gets caught flirting with another brad or buffy next door... what starts as a good evening gets muzzled up with a bad incident well let's say this bad incident was the crostada. Mind you, I am not in any way an exceptional baker but I admit to being a fan of the best pastries ever presented to me thanks to close family friends, a husband and wife team that are pastry chefs themselves and work in two top tier international hotels. Like what Sara said, that crostada was not a flaky pastry... it was like bread with an apple topping. I liked it since it wasn't that sweet but the apples were too tart and with a dry crust, the only thing to enjoy was the scoop of vanilla gelato. So a no go with the crostada and sadly I was disappointed by the in-house pastry chef... maybe next time I'll get the Tiramisu. \n\nSo overall, it was a good experience at the Parlor, a place that I can see myself returning in the near future with friends and family. The dessert was not memorable in any way except that it was dry and I can't wait to try out the other pizzas or the Seafood Linguine. So four forks for the Parlor!", "type": "review", "business_id": "pwpl-rxwNRQdgqFz_-qMPg"}

My only criticism of The Parlor is how popular it is. I showed up earlier than my fella (not MY fella, the guy) and wasn't sure where to go. This place is *so* popular it's kind of hard to sort out where to stand. The bar was buzzing and the outside area was hopping. So as a single gal I kind of hovered until I could procure wine.

If you want to be a complete glutton, and get the most bang for your buck, you must put First on your list of restaurants to hit up in Vegas.\n\nIt's only been open for about two months, so we actually just stumbled upon it while we were on our way out of The Shoppes at Palazzo. We were drawn in by the really cool space, and their touch screen menu outside posted extremely appealing inexpensive gourmet comfort food options. Once inside, we got seated at one of the large booths looking out onto the Strip, so we had a perfect view of the pirate show across the street at TI. \n\nInstead of plain old bread, we were brought pretzels that came with three dipping sauces. If you want, they offer a $5 cheese fondue to go with it. Our server, Carolyn, was awesome, and gave us recommendations on the food and drinks. We decided to start off with the Mojito Lamb Chops which were topped with Mint glaze, 151 and lime and torched at the table. We were impressed with the three thick cuts, and they were perfectly medium-rare. For entrees, I had the wide papardelle pasta with a heaping portion of forest mushrooms in a delicious truffle butter sauce. My guy had the Sesame Miso Glazed Salmon topped with seaweed salad on a bed of sticky rice, which was fantastic. The presentation was beautiful and the salmon was nice and flaky. For dessert, we indulged in the chocolate bar (which tasted like a 100 Grand as an ice cream bar) and the donut sundae... mmm... donut. \n\nFor cocktails, I highly recommend the Cotton Candy Kiss (Grey Goose, elderflower, vanilla, pineapple, cranberry), especially if you're a sweet tooth. It's such a pretty cocktail, and even the presentation is lovely! The martini glass is rimmed with crushed Life Savers and comes with a blue fluff of cotton candy. The liquor is poured over it when it's brought to the table. \n\nThe awesome thing is that they are open late, and I mean really late. They have a special late night menu from 1am-4am Sun-Wed and 1am-6am Th-Sat.\n\nThis place would be amazing in the Mission in SF -- foodie hipsters would flock here... I hope they open one up there!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "JauLZ0TL3D3VIGtSnStzhA"}

They have even enticed my aunts and uncles to come here and they actually do on a regular basis. Prices range from 4.99-5.99 offered 11am-4:30pm (I forget if its only on week days, but I know for sure Holidays are excluded). I really like the beef chow fun and we usually order the salt and pepper pork chops. The chow fun is definitely up to par, but I think other Chinese restaurants wip up a better salt and pepper pork. I think it's probably the batter, which is not as crisp as other places.  When I went a few weeks ago we also ordered the Seafood hot pot, mongolian beef, and fried flounder.  All of it was pretty standard and nothing special, but I guess I shouldn't complain because it could be a lot worse.  The fried flounder's batter could also be a little more crisp.  In my parents opinion inexpensive prices is what makes the food taste better. The service is pretty bad, but I guess I'm used to it because most Chinese restaurants tent to forget about customers after they place the food on the table. I also read on other reviews that they try to avoid giving you water, which is true! I've even heard this from my aunt who also comes here regularly.  We were 3/4 done with our meal and no one even checked on us. So finally after waving my hands in the air I was able to ask for water.

Not so much.  The pancit (my favorite Filipino entree) seemed to lack flavor and/or seasoning.  I also wanted more meat and veggies - maybe that's just due to what I'm used to.  It was more just oily noodles and missed that flavor I wanted.  The good news is the pancit is cooked to order so it's very fresh and hot - just be prepared to wait a few minutes.\n\nI was also very excited to get some lumpia.  Again, not so much.

I'll go back and give it another go - I'll give the chicken adobo (my other favorite) a shot for some redemption.\n\nA few tips:\n*If you order pancit, order first because everyone's items are not brought out at once and the rest of your party will be waiting on you.\n*It is a small place - tough to fit the 5 of us.

The buffet is small, and the food is well prepared and tasty.   Most of the main dishes have been the same the few times we have been here, but on the other hand, you can count on your favorites being there next time you go, and being sure that you can get your fix.\n\nThe Chicken Tikka Marsala is my favorite, along with the vegetable pakoras, and of course, the freshly cooked naan brought to your table.  I have never been a fan of samosas, however my vegetarian friend tells me they are the best around. My only complaint would be that the gulab jamun are not served warm.\n\nIf you are looking for a classy Indian restaurant to bring a date, this is not it.  It is simple place with the most basic of tables and decor.\n\nIf you are looking for a good Indian food at a very good price, then you need to try this hideaway.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z5v1F-tAV897ZmM32N0wfQ"}

The were a little larger than an average street taco and the fillings were plentiful.  I wish they had been corn tortillas rather than flour, but that didn't take away from the overall flavor.\n\nYes, for Pittsburgh the tacos are a bit expensive.

The catfish was also excellent.\n\nHowever, the ribs can use some improvement.  While the sauce is abundant and provides lots of flavor, the pork rib I had was tender and meaty, but could use more smoke in the marinade/grilling process (I tried the beef rib on my previous visit, which was covered in sauce, yet could have used more marinade to tenderize the meat).\n\nOverall, Mack Ribz is worthy of a visit.

And boy is it a bevy. It rivals Sharp Edge in quantity and quality selections but has a slight edge because it's next door to its own brewery. Copper Kettle Brewing Company churns out local suds and also allows patrons to brew their own batches. Please and thank you. That post is for another day though.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by Hough's when I first saw it. I had it pegged for a dark, dank, Pittsburgh-style Yinzer bar but was greeted with a bright and large space full of a diverse crowd. The bar itself was also quite large which is always convenient for the single diner/drinker. And stashed in one corner was a shuffle board! Can you feel the excitement!\n\nHough's had a feature beer menu and a regular beer menu. The menu is broken down by brand rather than style which can be slightly overwhelming for a beer novice like myself. The great part about the beer menu is that it offers a sample size so you can taste a beer before committing to a full pint. This proved to be a lifesaver. Or a life ruiner. Hard to say.\n\nAfter I got my beer order out of the way, I got down to the really important part: food. I heard the menu had changed but not for the better. It was standard bar food selections with a few gems one of which was a Sloppy Joe. And I didn't pass that up. My dining partner wanted hummus to start with and I obliged.\n\nThe hummus arrived and was quite possibly the saddest appetizer I've ever seen. For being \"homemade,\" it sure tasted like it came out of a plastic tub. It lacked any real flavor and had the texture of wet paste. My Sloppy Joe came out soon after. It came on a semi-hard bakery-style bun that held up well to the sloppy but the meat/sauce had no tang. No zip. No personality which is the real highlight of a sloppy joe for me otherwise it's really just a hamburger with too much ketchup. And the cole slaw... so sad. It may have looked like delicious cole slaw from Chick-fil-a (blagh) but it was partially frozen and again had no flavor.\n\nMy brother joined the party a bit after we finished dinner and had the Mac-n-Cheese. It had a rich, cheesy flavor but the portion looked to be a side rather than an entree. And at the price point it's offered at was quite a disappointment.\n\nOverall, I was a tad disappointed by the food but the beer and atmosphere made up for it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fGTrdnKyM_wdT6niaxzU3Q"}

After driving out to Pusadee's Garden and discovering it was closed, we did a quick Yelp search for the next closest place...and ended up at Smiling Banana Leaf.\n\nAfter a short 15-20 minute wait, we were seated at a table in the tiny dining room.  Not a bad wait, considering we didn't have a reservation.  I ordered tom yum soup and green curry with tofu and couldn't have been happier with my selections.  They will ask you on a scale of 1-10 how spicy you want your food, and they aren't afraid to really add some heat.  The portions are large, the food is flavorful and spicy, and everything came out quickly.  My boyfriend, who ordered the tom kha soup and panang curry, was equally as happy.  We left Smiling Banana Leaf full, happy, and with leftovers that tasted even better the next day.\n\nAfter our dinner at Smiling Banana Leaf, I craved that green curry all week long.  I even went so far as to attempt to make my own green curry.  And I've never made any sort of curry in my life.  Needless to say, I think I'll leave it to the chefs at Smiling Banana Leaf.\n\nWe decided to make our second trip to the restaurant less than a week later.  We rarely eat at the same place twice, especially so soon after our first visit.  But we had to make an exception for this place.  This time, we planned ahead by making reservations and bringing a bottle of wine.  I decided to switch it up and try the tofu eggplant with basil, which was tasty but came out a bit cold.  My boyfriend again went with the panang curry, and enjoyed it just as much the second time.  Next time, I will probably switch back to a curry as well.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Smiling Banana Leaf.   The service is always super speedy and friendly, the food is delicious, and the value is great.  Considering how small the dining room is (probably seats about 25 people), I would suggest making a reservation.  It can also get quite loud when the dining room is full.  Keep in mind that the restaurant is also BYOB. I would rate this restaurant a 4.5/5 if I could, but for now I'll give it a 5.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q"}

There was a so-so dipping sauce.  \n\nI ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry Thai Hot.  I was pleased that the curry was Thai Hot, the way I ordered it.  So many Thai restaurants are afraid to make a dish too hot.  The chicken was sliced very thin.  There were sliced onions, sliced carrots, and 3 soft potato chunks in a pretty ceramic bowl and a scoop of rice.\n\nI finished my lunch and 3 tables were still waiting for their food.  The party of 3 ordered some appetizers so they were happy.

Ah f*ck it, here goes. \n\nThe first visit to Hula's was a celebratory dinner/drinks with our realtor/mortage broker after a marathon short sale that finally closed. Needless to say we were ready to drink. Too damn hot to sit outside but the patio seems to be where it's at. Started off with a double Mai Tai, it was strong and tasty. The menu has lots of veggie/vegan options and we had some sweet potato fries and wakame salad as apps, both great. One double Mai Tai down the hatch we got some edamame, now all edamame is pretty much the same everywhere I have ever gotten it but this was amazing! I should point out that this was after 1.5 STRONG double Mai Tai's but the edamame had some spices on it that really made it stand out.\n\nFor dinner I got the Jamaican Jerk tofu which was simple but very good. After reading all the negative reviews on the food I wonder if I have such an underwhelming sense for decent food or everyone else is just plain wrong - jury is still out.\n\nAt this point in the evening I realize my girlfriend who is 1/2 my weight has kept pace with me and consumed the exact same about of Mai Tai's as I have - uh oh, this could get interesting.

Half the group doesn't make it there or passes out in a random chair while I hijack the hosts Itunes account to get some decent music playing.

It's a relatively new spin-off of Tomaso's Restaurant which has been at that location for 32 years. Where Tomaso's is upscale, dressier, and heavy on the proteins, Tommy V is casual and carb-oriented. It's interesting that the prices on most of the appetizers, salads and pastas are pretty much the same at both locations.\n\n     Tommy V's is divided up into two rooms. You enter the bar area which also houses an open kitchen with wood burning pizza oven. It's light-filled and colorful. and also very loud. The second room is more sedate, and unfortunately somewhat gloomy. It's dimly lit, and the faux brick, dark wood, and taupe painted walls don't help. There are some windows cut into the front and back walls, framed with curtains, which look into the bar area, and a third back room. Very weird. However, the gloom was dispelled when our cheerful waitress brought us a basket of crusty bread and some fabulous pesto butter, redolent of garlic. She informed us that happy hour was on (from 5 - 7), and we could get most of the wines on the menu for $5 a glass or $20 a bottle. We decided to share a glass of red Primitivo 'Layer Cake' (I don't know why it was called that, but you knew that I wouldn't be able to resist ordering it). It turned out to be delicious, rich and deeply fruity. Because we had arrived quite early - I didn't know how busy the restaurant would be and reservations are only taken for tables of 6 - we ordered a roasted beet and goat cheese salad ($8) while we awaited our friends Walt and Maria. While it was quite good, it didn't live up to the one we had at The Parlor since the beets weren't multi-colored and the dressing didn't have as much zing. However, there was lots of cheese and toasted pistachios.\n\n     When Walt and Maria arrived, our bread basket and carafe of butter was swiftly refilled (the bussing was top notch). I suggested that they try the Primitivo, and they ordered the Romaine Wedge salad ($7) with bacon and gorgonzola. It was beautifully presented, with a pile of whole romaine leaves holding the accompaniments and dressing. All the salad ingredients were quite fresh. I ordered an Eggplant Torta ($15), described as \"Baked Multi-layer of Eggplant, Cheese Fondue, Pasta\". Ken opted for V's Kick Ass Burger 9 oz ($12) - \"Handcrafted with Short Rib, Brisket & Kobe Beef, Caramelized Onions, Heirloom Tomatoes, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Arugula, Truffle Aioli & Parmesan Herb Roasted Potatoes\". The combination of meats made this too interesting to pass up. Walt and Maria decided to share a pizza. These are \"personal size\", 10 - 12 inches, and range in price from $10 for a Margherita with mozzarella and tomatoes to \n$16 for a Proscuitto and Fig pie with gorgonzola and arugula. Unfortunately I don't remember what kind they had, but they said they enjoyed it, and it was actually big enough that 2 pieces were taken home. The burger was great. It was big and juicy with a fascinating texture because of the short ribs and brisket - it's now my favorite Phoenix burger, and the price is comparable to the other good ones served elsewhere. Ken loved the roasted potatoes, and while they were flavorful, I prefer nice crunchy fries. My eggplant torta was a pleasant, non-confrontational variant of eggplant parmesan. But having taken a Zantac, I was looking forward to confrontation - a spicy sauce and loads of gooey cheese. This was disappointing, but edible. It was also a fairy small portion.\n\n     There were no surprises on the dessert menu - tiramisu, cannoli, etc. We ordered a tartufo for the table. When it arrived, nicely sliced, there was none of the zablione promised on the menu. I asked the waitress about that and she tried to tell me that it had been \"mixed in\". When I gave her a skeptical, unhappy look she brought over the owner/manager (I'm not sure which he was), and he apologized, saying that there's been a dispute with the distributor over that item. We weren't charged for it, which was very nice, since we did eat it all.\n\n     The parking in front of the restaurant is limited, but Walt said to tell you that immediately to the east of the strip mall containing the restaurant there's a large parking lot, not particularly visible to the street. All in all I'd say this was a good dining experience and we'll go back to try some of the interesting pastas like braised short rib gnocchi ($20) or butternut squash ravioli with amaretto cookies, toasted almonds and parmigiano sage sauce ($15). And especially to have another burger!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "0AZiq_OMKs3I9lTmwd5PSg"}

And Glaziers has a really beautiful deli with a super easy & convenient kiosk for ordering. It's stocked with everything you could ever want. Except a staff that knows how to slice this superior product. My cheese is consistently dirty. Meaning you can see remnants of the last cheese they sliced all over my cheese--same thing has happened with my ham...remnants of roast beef all over it. The cheese is never nicely sliced or separated by wax, by the time I get home, all the slices are kinda just molded into one lump. Impossible to separate without it tearing. If I order something sliced thin or very thin, I shouldn't have a bag full of of thick slabs of meat. I've ordered 'very thin' salami and it's so thick that you would think it's a joke. It has happened so often that I just go to Smith's for my Boars Head. But every once in a while, I'll stop at Glaziers and give the deli another chance. And it always ends in total disappointment.

First off, our waitress was highly unskilled, fidgety and downright uncomfortable.  She babbled about the menu, and steered us away from the most exciting concept of this new \"American\" cuisine restaurant....the supposedly locally grown monthly chef's menu.  She noted several times that they were proud of their \"scratch\" kitchen, and the menu had our mouths watering.  \n\nEverything was just OK at this point - we weren't going to let a bad server ruin our night.  Until every other waiter offered their tables bread but ours, so we sat for 40 min. with no bread, no visit from our waitress, who was busy goofing off and flirting with everything and everyone on staff.  When our food finally came, we realized REALLY quickly, that there was nothing fresh nor creative, nor yummy about this food.  It was so disappointing.  On top of it all, it was super expensive.  I paid $22 for a steak and $25 for ribs that I could have gotten better at Perkins off the beltline, and I would never even go there.  We wondered how the food could have possibly been executed so poorly.\n\nThe food/veggies was so overcooked and felt like the whole meal came \"fresh\" from the microwave or a leftover Tupperware container.  Mashed potatoes were clearly from powder and scooped onto the plate with an industrial scooper, the BBQ sauce tasted allot like the Kraft crap at the grocery store. I guess all we were missing were the Bush's baked beans, b/c EVERYTHING was from a can not from scratch.  We were sad.\n\nThe worst part about this place is that it could be so great.  The menu, if cooked and presented properly is a great concept, they have obviously dumped allot of money into this place.  I hope that the investors wake up soon, try the amazing food of their competitors in town (Harvest, Sardine, Brasserie V, Quivey's Grove, Great Dane...and the list goes on), study the competitive pricing, and get the chef some cooking lessons.  Also, stop lying to customers about everything being from scratch!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IDzoyWfSInajUDnsN3wW6g"}

We had debated and flipped coins about whether or not we were going to eat here. I wanted a fish taco dammit! \n\nSo initially we had just intended to meet up with Bill F for pre dinner drinks, but after much temptation and some passive coaxing by the super friendly waiter, we ended up ordering some appetizers and sides. \n\nOrdered up the rosemary martini. A Rosemary sprig came inside the glass which was cool, but it had a strong tart martini mix flavor. The Ginny Hendrix, the cucumber infused martini was just okay. Martinis are $12, but half off last night. Without the discount, I think I would rather have martinis at Therapy. \n\nThere are three things I want to highlight as far as food. \n\nTo start your meal, complimentary chicken liver pate with bread. I'm not much of a liver person, but this was good. Rich and of course had a strong bitter liver flavor. \n\nNext is this puff bread pastry thingy lined with gruyere cheese. This was amazing. It is served with a sweet cream butter and sea salt. It is a play on the sweetness and savory saltiness. Two very different tastes, one bread. With the cream, it had a buttery popcorn, croissant taste. With the salt, a pretzel taste. Hats off to the pastry chef for this fun treat. They also provided lil card with the recipe. I think its for us, the guest, not sure but we took it home anyways...Shhhh\n\nOysters. These were some damn good, fresh, tasty oysters. They are served with a malt vinegar/garlic sauce and traditional cocktail sauce. Most importantly, a small bottle of tabasco. The malt vinegar on oysters was something I've never had. Not my preference, but good nonetheless.\n\nNow I don't know about you, but I absolutely hate the \"would you like bottled, carbonated, or tap water\" question. How many people actually drink anything other than tap water at a restaurant? Bottled, I understand, carbonated though? Carbonated water is gross. lol\n\nHeck, sometimes I don't feel like getting all dolled up and just want a nice meal. BLT isn't so ostentatious that you feel it's necessary to suit it up. I wore Vans, the party next to us split their meal three ways. The staff wasn't condescending or belittling and thats how it should be.\n\nTo sum it up, I like BLT. Decor is contemporary, much more appealing to me personally. I prefer the modern steakhouse more than the traditional steakhouse. Most traditional steakhouses are just too stuffy for me. \n\nAnd yes, the music did get annoying. It wasn't blaring loud, it was like an annoying muffled loud coming from the upstairs neighbor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TpNz3nBaw4tEz_tnnxH-4A"}

Admittedly, when comparing prices with the original Los Angeles venue, the Vegas spot appears much more expensive. Predictable.\n\nNot really seeing a deathly spicy option (not saying that I was gonna find one), I got whatever could be interpreted as spicy to some people. The Spicy Mojave Dog ($8.49) was my choice. Yeah, you read that right. It was gonna basically be $9 with tax for a damn hot dog. Polish sausage, nacho cheese, pickled jalapenos, grilled onions, guacamole, and tomatoes.\n\nIt looked and tasted like your basic hot dog bun here. With the larger Polish sausage and an abundance of toppings, it really needed one of those large gourmet buns to even give me a shot to pick it up. Fork and knife would have to do.\n\nFlavor-wise, it did the job. It's basically as good as I could have expected this to be. Great snap from the Polish dog. Nacho cheese felt like it came from a container. The veggies and the guacamole tasted fresh. My issue is simply the price. There's no way this poor panda would even want to pay around $9 for a hot dog, even if edible gold was attached to this sucker. Besides, I'd take the edible gold and try to extract monetary value from it anyway.\n\nI look at the Yelp reviews for the Los Angeles Pink's, and it's around a three-star average, same as the Vegas spot. Any complaints are likely directed at the price or the hot dog not living up to the hype. The line's also longer in L.A., so that probably also affects the reviewer's rating. Still, it makes me wonder if the Los Angeles spot is better.\n\nPink's was good for the experience. I can't complain much about the food other than not being able to pick it up.

But enough about that!\n\nIn just six weeks time, this restaurant transformed into FnB, the creation of Pavle Milic and Chef Charleen Badman.  It now has a bit more space and a warmer, lighter feeling to it... the tile on the floor is really unique and colorful.  You can tell it's a family-run business too... we felt extremely welcome from the moment we set foot inside and we met the entire staff, Emily, Josh, Pavle, Chef Charleen, and Sous Chef Sasha.\n\nBut enough about the atmosphere and the fantastic staff, I'm sure you want to know about the food!\n\nThe menu is limited, but pretty much everything on it is appealing.  Luckily, our table was up for sharing.  We started with two orders of the crispy rock shrimp & jalapeno tartar and a fried green tomato salad.  Both were delicious... I especially enjoyed the combination of the fried green tomatoes with green goddess dressing and feta.  \n\nWe continued with the citrus marinated olives as an appetizer to share... they aren't kidding with the \"citrus\" description - you can really taste it and I loved it!\n\nJared and I shared the boneless trout entree and our companions shared the roast jidori chicken entree and we all shared an order of the spigarello.  What's spigarello? It's similar to broccoli rabe but not quite as bitter.  Chef Charleen prepares it with garlic and chili and it's delicious!  Needless to say, we cleaned all of our plates!\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, we proceeded to order one of each of the dessert offerings: a lemon creme brulee, an apple crisp, and the cherry chocolate bread pudding that Angela mentioned in her review.  The lemon brulee and the bread pudding were the favorites at our table.  And from listening to Pavle talk about it, I think the chocolate bread pudding is his favorite too!\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention that I was the only drinker in our group last night... I had a glass of sauvignon blanc - one from Chile - and it was perfect.\n\nThe prices aren't bad considering everything used at this restaurant is bought fresh daily from local farms.  We'll be back to see our friends at FnB again soon... and I encourage you to go check out this little gem of a restaurant as well!  Just make sure to save us a seat at the bar.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IuAPYzf3NSyfyXYgT46YVA"}

The early summer menu was truly memorable.\n\nAppetizers:\n\n- The beets were full of flavor and the special creme freche like sauce really made them pop\n- The braised leeks with the fried egg were incredibly good.  \n- The lamb appetizer had mixed reviews.  I didn't think it was special, but two in our party really enjoyed them.\n\nMains:\n\n- The lamb, artichoke moussaka was full of flavor.  I was fortunate enough to have the last serving. \n- The lamb chops are either the best or second best (see braised leeks) item on the menu.  So many flavors that tumble over.  Really enjoyed it.\n- The sea bass was sea bass.  It was a little more grilled than usual, which gave it a nice flavor, but nothing to write home about\n- My wife and friend loved the seafood pasta, but I can't comment too much, as I did not partake\n\nDesserts: \n\n- The cornbread.  Well, I didn't have it, but the three in my party that did all loved it\n- The Eton Mess was amazing.  Instead of strawberries, they used rhubarb.  The tartness of the rhubarb went perfectly with the meringue and cream.  I wish I had some right now for breakfast.\n\nService:\n\n- Excellent.  Very helpful.  Very friendly.  Great timing.  Except for the end (see below).\n\nFnB would have gotten five stars and still can in the future, but one thing really irked me.  We were rushed out.  The check came while we were still having dessert.  Ok, no problem, but usually you ask for the check.  Then after we had finished dessert and two in our party were still drinking their coffees, our server came and told us that there was no rush but that people were waiting for our table.  Ok, so that's a little off putting.  Two minutes later, the hostess came over and told us the same thing.  Ok, we got the point.  We'd only been there for 2.5 hours and the coffees were still half full.  Not a great ending, but I'll chalk it up as a mulligan and hope it doesn't happen again because the rest of the evening was excellent.\n\nOh, and they need more comfortable chairs.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IuAPYzf3NSyfyXYgT46YVA"}

How about this; \"MRKT Sea & Land is a restaurant in search of an identity.\" I do not say this lightly, but this is really the case and it was quite apparent as the dining experience went alone.\n\nMy wife and I decided to step out to a \"Higher End\" restaurant for our 2nd anniversary. We had $25 restaurant.com discount (knowing this bill would probably be about $100) so we felt like we could order freely without worrying about price. So armed we sallied forth.\n\nWith the exception of \"being given the eye\" when we walked in the staff was on the whole polite and helpful. When things didn't quite work out they were very accommodating and understanding. The restaurant itself is well designed and inviting with a music track that is up-tempo without being too loud. The booths were not easy to get into and out of, but I call this a quirk. Lighting could have been a little more subdued to add to the \"higher end\" restaurant experience they were after, but again I call this a quirk of their choices. It did all add up to something I call \"AKC\" (more later) atmosphere, but it was easily handled.\n\nThis restaurant has all the trappings of wanting to be a marquee 5 star restaurant but just does not know how to do it, and it was all the little things that gave them away. For example, when refilling our Iced Tea the server poured the tea over the table towards us, a no-no in fine dining. The second time I lifted my glass and set it away from me so the server should get the hint, but still he left the glass on the table and refilled the tea. But then he made another mistake and lifted the glass next to the rim and set in down in front of me. Oops. (Would you like to drink from a rim of a glass where the server just touched? Didn't think so.) It was not until later that our server (who was also tending bar) refilled our drinks correctly by lifting the glass by the base, filling it away from the table and returning back by the base. These kind of details were all missing from the experience.\n\nSo let's talk about the food. My wife ordered the Prime Rib (16oz. cut), generous for the price of $25 and the Potatoes Au Gratin ($7 more). I order the Bone In Rib Eye (also 16oz.) for $38 and a simple Baked Potato (also $7 more). Obviously the ordering is all al-a-carte, something I personally do not like because I feel it is just a scam to up your bill. Also there ends up being so many plates on the table it interferes with the dining experience. \n\nWhen you are in a casino there are many kitchens, a dedicated kitchen for a specific restaurant and a more general kitchen for the hotel overall. Sometimes you can get crossover between kitchens and the taste can be reflected in the food. I think this was the case here. I feel like there was crossover because the recipes and preparation were so old school it left little to enjoy. Item by item: The Prime Rib was good but lacked any kind of real taste and had a huge piece of fat in the middle. (Yes, I know there is supposed to be an eye of fat, but this was at least 5oz.) So the Prime Rib was your standard buffet Prime Rib, a bit disappointing. The Potatoes Au Gratin were made with AMERICAN CHEESE AND THE POTATOES WERE INCIPIENTLY OVER COOKED. We sent it back and hope they get a better recipe for the future, not something from 1978. Now for the Rib Eye; I kinda asked for it I guess, I asked if the steak was aged or not. When the answer came back \"it was fresh\" I knew right there that there may be trouble. Indeed, as the steak cooled and I got to the center it became apparent this piece of meat had been frozen at some time. (If you are a steak lover you know what I mean as the texture of the steak become mealy. In fairness I do not know this to be fact, but in my opinion, and that is what matters here, it was frozen at some point.) For $38 I would hope for an aged steak, especially a Rib Eye that shines the longer it is aged. It was not 2 weeks ago that I had a 21 day aged Porter House and the flavor blew my head off it was so good, so I had something to compare it to. Are you seeing where I am heading here, this was fair food from a buffet, but NOT a restaurant looking to be something better.\n\nI say this with all the love from my heritage and totally tongue and cheek; \"AKC\" stands for Alter Kocker Certified. This is a restaurant that is primarily patronized by our senior citizens because the food is the same as it was in 1962 and generally does not challenge the diner. You know these establishments when you see them, and unfortunately MRKT is AKC in disguise; nothing challenging but nothing to make it noteworthy. The only thing outstanding when all is said and done is the price, and if they keep this cooking (not cuisine) they will not be around long.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vD1O9KUC8SeThsD0xltBpw"}

My husband and I really love this place.  In Mesa this really is our Cheers. The owners Cameron and Cindy are about as welcoming as you can get.  Owning a restaurant can't possibly be an easy thing to do, but they sure do it with a smile.  \n\nSo last week we decided on a Tuesday night that we'd go to dinner at iLv, because he hadn't been in a while, I asked what the specials were on FB and we were pretty set on what we were going to have for dinner that night. Not to mention that I was totally craving their classic bruscetta it simply is the best I've ever had.  I could eat that as a meal all on its own.  My husband had the trout special and really enjoyed it, I had a bite and was pleased that it didn't have that fishy taste that trout can sometimes have.  I can't really speak for him on his experience but I sure can speak for mine.  I had the beer battered fish and chips, and all I can say is OMG.  I have had good fish and chips very rarely here in the United States, and I'm very selective about it,  because I got spoiled when I visited the UK.  If you've never had fish and chips in England you must put this on your bucket list. But back to this particular fish and chips.  I would pit this up against anything I had in the UK, it was just THAT good. The batter was light and airy and not dripping with grease.  My 5 stars is for that fish alone, if I could add more stars just because of service I would.  \n\nGood wine, good food, and good company.

It could've been a meal in itself.\n\nI guess we were hungrier than we thought that night because we had to take a doggy bag home...  \n\nChart House is a beautiful restaurant that is well-kept.

The order going down is how we ordered with the category that it is in. We went in 3's as the tapas come out very quickly!\n\n1. Tuna Raspberry Skewers - Unique twist on sushi. Square in shape, and eaten like a lollipop, I never thought tuna and raspberries would work, but they do! The tuna was soft, the raspberries sweet, but still tart. The crazy thing is that the raspberry is on the side, and they are filled with wasabi. So you eat the tuna skewer + the raspberry with wasibi, and wala ~ tasty tuna sushi. Rating: 4/5\n\n2. Creamy Risotto - The risotto was cooked perfectly, and the wild mushrooms stood out. The manchego cheese was pungent, but tasty tasty because of it's different texture. Rating: 4/5\n\n3. Stuffed Dates - So good! SOOOOO SOOOOO GOOD! This one stood out for us. The date covered in crispy pancetta with the tomato marmalade stuffed with goat cheese. Melt in your mouth FOODGASM. Rating: 5/5\n\n4. White Ceviche - This was a really zesty and fresh ceviche. The white fish was soft, and the mixture of peppers, red onions, and cilantro gave a good bite. Served with crackers, I felt that there may have been too much lime juice. Rating: 3.5/5\n\n5. Spanish Tortilla - This I felt was a take on breakfast & hashbrowns. While many will say it is nothing special, I am a hashbrown feen, so I found it delicious lol. Rating: 3.5/5\n\n6. Octopus - I've NEVER -- EVER -- EVERRRRRRRRRRRRR had octopus this soft before. It was ridiculous how soft it was. I don't know how they got it like this, but some parts just tasted like bone marrow consistency. With potato & Spanish paprika, it was a simple delight. Rating: 4/5\n\n7. Yellowtail with Yam - The crispy yam made this tapa stand out. For if there was none, it would of just been sashimi, and I wouldn't have paid for it. Fresh fish, crispy sweet yam. A sweet and savory combo that worked. Rating: 3.5/5\n\n8. Lobster Saffron - Half lobster tail, saffron oil, iberian pork, creamy potatoes, asparagus. The lobster was wrapped with the iberian pork. The tail was juicy, the potatoes as well. This felt more like a little entree. While delicious, I'm not sure if it was worth getting. Rating: 3/5\n\n9. Albondigas - Oh fluffy fluffy meatballs. So simple, yet so good. Great light sweet tomato sauce. Succulent juicy meatballs that just melt in your mouth. Potatoes in squares lightly crispy. Can I get a side order of rice to fill my Asian needs, and pasta to fill my love for Italian please? Rating: 4/5\n\nSo that was the meal, and as you can see, we ordered a good amount for two people. It filled us, but it didn't overfill us, and that's what we enjoyed. There was nothing bad about the meal, and everything was prepared well. For the price, some may question it, but it's Vegas. I would complain if the food was horrible, but it simply wasn't. You can go ahead and spend $60-80 on a piece of steak medium rare, or come here and experience more for your money! Julian Serrano gets 4.5/5 from me! I may get adventurous next time around and eat things that Yelp has yet to see from here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqD7X5CHXnJ14YbBBlLx1w"}

Just take a look at The Living Room, a happening indoor/outdoor bar with an attractive wait staff, tasty sangria and om nom nommable eats. Now that I work in Chandler full-time, it's quickly become my favorite go-to for happy hour and lunch, with a vibe that's more downtown Phoenix than family-filled suburbs.\n\nThe place is open and airy, with the indoors spilling out to the patio, no wall dividing the two. Dark wood and burnt orange furniture decorate the space, with the funky color scheme giving the spot a Mediterranean vibe. Comfy couches surrounded by fireplaces outside are perfect for lounging, while high-tops and an expansive bar with sports televisions inside give drinkers and diners more options.\n\nThe place gets packed during \"normal\" happy hour time, but if you're a day drinker, you're in luck, since happy hour prices are available from open to 6 p.m. Definitely try a glass of sangria ($5 during happy hour) - I loved the red version I got, since it was really fruity but strong. There's an extensive wine list, as well as a mixed cocktail selection, if fruity sangria isn't your thing.\n\nThe food at The Living Room is also mighty tasty. The Caprese sandwich ($9.95), with thick mozzarella, a pesto sauce, juicy grape tomatoes and a balsamic glaze that perfectly ties everything together, is delicious. I love it with a mixed green salad with lemon caper vinaigrette - the salad reminds me of another favorite salad of mine, at The Main Ingredient in Phoenix.\n\nEven if you don't live in Chandler, I'd say The Living Room is a destination spot and should entice you to venture out South if you don't usually head that direction.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q9WaFYhlOZCrfXJQTG5t_Q"}

The ribeye was cooked perfectly and marbled well with fat.  We tried a few sides since we were with some friends.  Honestly, the sides were underwhelming (jalapeno creamed corn, sweet potato tots, brussel sprouts).  I definitely would not pay the regular price for the sides again.  A few of the appetizers were half price, so we tried the spicy mussels ($13).  The marinara sauce that these mussels come with is addicting, we kept asking for more bread to sop up all the sauce.  The bread is warm, freshly toasted baguette and perfect for soaking up all the garlicky goodness.    Honestly, the price of most of their happy hour items is what I would probably expect to pay normally.  The items on their food menu seem grossly overpriced for this location, so unless you are here for happy hour....I say there are better options.  I highly recommend if you want a good steak and don't want to pay a visit to your cheap steakhouses like Outback, then to come give Herbs and Rye a try.

The drinks were lesser quality, made by bartenders I didnt recognize from prior visits to Herbs & Rye.  My group had 11 cocktails  and 9 were just slightly off making the drink a little harsh to swallow.  We are cocktail  people and travel to places like tails of the cocktail  in new orleans for cocktails and this was the worst sazerac I've ever had.  My group of 4 agreed that the drinks were  not up to our expectations of a Herbs and Rye cocktail.  \nSecondly, the steaks were filled with fat and 1 with way too much gristle. We had amazing steaks in our past visits  to Herbs and Rye and this visits quality was very disappointing for our whole group. I known that ribeyes are marbled with fat but this was excessive.   Don't believe gristle about the size of a tennis ball should be found in the middle of a New York steak.\nThird, we all were so disappointed to walk in and hear Michael Jackson,  stevie wonder and other 70's soul\nR & B being played.  We are use to the electro swing, jazzy lounge style of music they played all other times we have been there. Herbs & Rye has a great lounge feel / atmosphere. Playing the wrong style of music for its decor didn't make sense and to not hear the great lounge swing style of music was disappointing.\nIt altered the feel of this great restaurant and bar.\n\nAfter about $300, we had to sadly leave.  We ended up finishing the night at a different cocktail bar. We were very disappointed and discussed  our sadness over cocktails later that night and over breakfast the next day.  I sure hope management won't ruin this amazing place.  We recommend  it to everyone that will listen and after last night, I'm afraid to recommend it.\nLast night was 3/5 @ best\nAll past visits 5/5.   \nWILL BE BACK AGAIN BUT hoping our favorite bar just had a bad night.

I've grown to dearly love this place over the last year. The food is always good, the people are sweet and the ingredients are as quality as you can get. \n\nThe food, bread, pies, muffins and coffee drinks are all made fresh, in house by Olivier, his mom and dad. All of whom are from France. This seems to also be the congregating spot of the local French population. It's not unusual to see groups of French-speaking people dressed beautifully sipping a huge cup of coffee and dipping croissants into their beverage on most mornings. \n\nI adore their soups. Everyday there are 2 soups. Both usually vegetarian. Creamy Cauliflower, Vegetarian French Onion, Curry, Spinach...the combinations Olivier's dad whips up are phenomenal. Easily, the best soups I've ever had. The sandwiches are made on store-baked baguette and served with the freshest and crispest ingredients. Olivier's dad is such a sweetheart...sometimes I come in and ask for pasta and he creates a dish just for me. \n\nAnother dish that I think is marvelous is their pizza. Sometimes they have leek, sometimes roasted tomatoes and mushrooms...whatever they create, it's always sensational. The crust is thicker and definitely buttery and the toppings baked to perfection. Remarkable. \n\nBaguette Cafe's pastries and coffee are another pairing to treasure. The Caramel Macchiato is easily the tastiest and most satisfying morning drink I've had. Paired with their delectable fresh-baked croissants, breakfast is a heavenly experience. The dessert selection varies daily. Today they had chocolate tart and lemon meringue pie. Both made lovingly by Olivier's mommy. The meringue pie was perfection. Sweet, refreshing, smooth and made with actual lemon pieces, this clearly put all desserts to shame. They bake Madeleines in-house daily and have muffins and Pan de Chocolate (also immaculately baked fresh by the mom). \n\nPricing here is very very very reasonable. $6-$7 for a half and half combination lunch and $3-$4 for a healthy piece of dessert. \n\nA place as delectable as Baguette Cafe is not going to be a local hidden gem for much longer. I've seen it's popularity soar over the year and I know they are going to go places (as they should).

Putting their staff in tuxedos was as uncomfortable for me to see as for them to wear.  There was no pedigree in their training, beyond being polite, but polite is not what a tuxedo wears.  \"What can I get you guys...\"  and the minute a plate was near empty, a tuxedo would reach over you and yank it away.  You had to time your eating.\n\nI had an appetizer of escargot, and although generous in the portion, they were tasteless.  It needed seasoning, garlic, oil, butter, and white wine.\nFor dinner, I ordered Cavatappi Shrimp Natural.  Again, generous on the shrimp but tasteless.  It was pasta with shrimp. \n\nMy wife ordered a glass of house chardonnay and could not get past the first sip.  I tasted it and it was , honestly, undrinkable and I love finding cheap French wines. We had to get a $85 dollar William Hill Chardonnay to get through dinner.  Seriously ridiculous (400% markup)  My wife ordered their Hearts of iceberg appetizer with the hot bacon vinaigrette but it was so vinegary it was hard to eat and she could not finish it.  For diner she had the Coq au vin, but again--lack of seasoning.\n\nAll in all, it was so overpriced and under-delivered.  I felt really bad for the young couple at the adjoining table, hopefully they were overwhelmed with the view to make up for the lack of delight in dinner.  \n\nIf this place wants to survive, ditch the tuxedos, lower the prices dramatically and season the food.  The chef needs a pallet for seasoning, or is being held back by the owner.\n\nThe place was not very crowded.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ya0oNqP8mzPU5HwMdgf5zQ"}

High stools, a long counter and an individual burner for each guest are really all it takes for shabu shabu, no bells and whistles added.\n\nSecondly, it is incredibly well-priced and they make a perceptible effort to keep their prices down. In the two and more years I've been a patron, the prices haven't changed by a digit.\n\nRecession bit them too, so today instead of ice cream PLUS iced coffee for dessert, you get one or the other. Additionally, if before prices included tax, today the tax is extra. It is still a bargain.\n\nThirdly, the service is efficient, polite, cheerful and fast. I would go to Hanashima just to have the waitress smile at me.\n\nFourthly, the menu is simple but the meal is filling and involves a variety of courses. The extra sides you can order make the customisations almost endless.\n\nEven ethnic food sceptics appreciate the straightforwardness of Hanashima's approach and the sheer quality of their food. I've seen it happen first-hand.\n\nOther reviewers mentioned another website that lists Hanashima (restomontreal). After reading the reviews on Yelp, heading over there for the vouchers can actually offset the sales taxes (10%). (I hope this doesn't breach Yelp's terms).\n\nHanashima is a spot to keep in your books due to its perfection and its location. In the heart of Chinatown, it is close to great Chinese bakeries where you can get an extra dessert and bubble tea.\n\nI also recommend Hanashima for a cheap and no-strings-attached date, or for post-important-introductions dinners. The counter seating doesn't require guests to stare at each other for the meal's duration, the crowd, decor and food provide great converation starters and the gentle broth's bubbling fills in the necessary moments of silence.\n\nA relaxed meal in an unusual setting without the pressure of it being too unusual. Vegetarians are catered for with the huge veggie combo, meat-eaters are spoilt for choice, seafood lovers will delight in the seafood combo and everyone will have a great time at an excellent price.\n\nGet the regular portions, splurge because here you can!\n\nReserve whenever you go: I saw it fill up pretty fast on both weekday (sometimes) and weekend nights (always).", "type": "review", "business_id": "b6R-vvN8keWs99vbCVrKsw"}

Over medium well egg (?) and large biscuit on the side.  Oh and don't forget the wedge of watermelon!  Those things were also cocktail ornaments.

Started off with bottle of French champagne, loved it, the bread basket was so delicious, just too much for 2 people, it could easily feed up to 5 people seriously! \n\nThe hard part was to order, the entire meat section is out, that's pretty much all of the items on the menu. Saw seafood and sushi choices, a bit relieved really, glad I am usually a Pesce at nice restaurants, otherwise I would have nothing to order except salads or some sides, that would be miserable at a nice restaurant, wouldn't it ? \n\nOur server introduced lots of things, we decided to do chilled seafood platter first, a little bit of everything on the platter: The presentation of the platter was amazing, smokes came out of the prawns container, so beautiful and appetizing. The Kumamoto oysters were so good, the lobster claw meat was fairly tender. But the other things in there were bad, the crab & lobster meats were so hard and chewy, the prawns were even harder. They were hard to cut, even harder to swallow, we didn't finish them, so wasteful... The horseradish and cocktail sauces were so good, added nice flavors to chilled seafood. \n\nClam chowder soup with garlic bread: our server was so nice to split the soup for us, even though we didn't ask so, the soup was still huge after splitting, too bad I didn't want any soup, so I just gave it to hubby, kinda felt bad for our server's thoughtful gesture. \n\nLobster roll: had it as my entree, it was bad, really? The rice was thick, the stuffing was not that flavorful, I didn't like the cream sauce came with it, I had one and half pieces, and stopped eating. \n\n12 oz bone in filet in medium rare: the plate was 400 degrees hot! Perfectly cooked to medium rare, the steak melted in hubby's mouth right away, he said it tasted amazing! Absolutely loved every single bite of it! \n\nMushroom side: I love mushrooms so much, but those mushrooms were flavorless, they were just not that good. I had one bite, that's it. \n\nSo, either my taste buds were numbed from too much drinking? Or Mastro's is really just for steak lovers? My food was just bad... I didn't even eat that much, just sat there , sip on my champagne, and tried very hard not to fall asleep in the middle of a dinner date.... \n\nThey gave us anniversary chocolate cake with a lit candle, so beautiful, and a huge plate of whipped cream too. The cake was so good, both of us loved it, so yummy! I had a 20 -yr -old tawny ($27) to go with it, it was amazing. \n\nIt's a famous steakhouse, of course it's pricey. Reserved wine list starts at $100 a bottle, up to 10 thousand. Tab was $350 for two. \n\nTo be honest, I didn't like my food, dinner experience was good, I was just too sleepy to really enjoy it. Their restroom located upstairs next to private dining room, the elevator to upstairs was claustrophobic. \n\nAnd I don't think this place is good for dinner date, food is too much for two people, impossible to finish everything. The restaurant is too bright, not intimate at all. But it's great for family, group dining, or steak lovers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "1U1GRksKXF7q8FKcW0e5VQ"}

The service was friendly and very accommodating to our large group, but we left feeling bamboozled! \n\nFour of us in the group ordered a pitcher of Sangria. We were about 3/4ths of the way through the first pitcher, when another pitcher had been served to our table. None of us had wanted another pitcher, but started to drink it anyway as we all thought that someone else at the table had ordered a second one. There were about 12 people at our table so, it was hard to know who ordered what. We all asked each other \"who ordered the second pitcher?\" The answer was no one ordered the second pitcher, the server just served us a second one without asking, and added it to our tab. We felt that we couldn't dispute the check since we started to drink out of the second pitcher, even though we barely touched it as we all had to drive ourselves home that night.\n\nTo make matters worse, one of the woman in our group had ordered a glass of Chardonnay not knowing that there were several options on the menu. Instead of asking her which one she would like, they instead served her the most expensive one at $14 for one glass. If you have several different kinds of Chardonnay, why wouldn't they ask the patron which one they wanted?

I don't think too highly about the buffet.  In the 90s, it was the buffet to experience because of the quality and price.  Now it's only about the price.  Well, surprisingly, I was surprised that the Rio has one hell of a restaurant on site.\n\n\nMartorano's!!!!!  I went with three picky eaters.  We normally stay at the higher end casinos like The Wynn or Caesar's.  But we had to stay at the Rio due to Business reasons.  Well, we were tired so we chose this place.  What a great surprise.  In fact, it was the best meal I had during my 3 day trip, although the Wicked Spoon Buffet also ranks up there!\n\nMy friends are picky but they all three decided to have the Meatball Salad.  What a weird choice.  Meatball Salad????  But they LOVED it.  It was so memorable that we spoke about it weeks later.\n\nMe on the other hand, I don't like to follow everyone else so I decided to order something else.  I ordered the Bucatini Carbonara.  I love Carbonara.  I've had it in some of the best restaurants.  Beverly Hills, Paris France, New York.  Well, hands down, this was the BEST Carbonara I have ever had.  Wow.  It was so beautiful I wanted to take a picture but my friends would have laughed at me.  They are obviously not a foodie like me and my fellow Yelpers.  The Bucatini, which is a thicker spaghetti, was al dente.  Perfectly al dente.  The Carbonara was delicious.  It had a raw egg yolk on it and you had to pop it.  It goosed out and made the Carbonara authentically delicious.  I added some fresh ground black pepper and it was PERFECT.\n\nI actually think about it.  I recently had Linguini Carbonara at two fancy places in Los Angeles and was disappointed.  Martorano's has set the bar very high for me and has ruined Carbonara for me......unless I'm willing to make the trip to Las Vegas!!!!

It's interior is simple, modernistic, and clean which is always a plus for me. Their menu have rice combo that is to die for, varieties of ice cream flavor, and of course, boba drinks. :)\n\nI spoke with the boss and he told me everything on the menu are high quality and self selected by him (and his wife). Obviously he wants everything on the menu to surpass the rest of the other competitive stores out there. So skimming through the boba list, I decided to try the taro smoothie and several different types of ice cream. And I've got to say, he's right. Not only was the smoothie taste just right but you can really tell that it's not artificial taro flavor (I know because I drank so many taro smoothies that I know which one taste good and which is bad :P). The same with their ice cream! Omgg, I can really find myself to be a regular when summer arrives. Their creamy dessert makes me feel like a giddy child when I savor their delicious creation and I'm not even a fan of ice cream! Mmm I can feel my day become all better already just by thinking of it. :)\n\nSo overall, from my personal experience, I'll say you'll get your money worth when you come Boba City.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wRnX8AV5CAAJnEgReTMaHw"}

I've been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. Stop wasting money on expensive smaller prime ribs at Outback or some other steakhouse. The large prime rib here is $16.95 and comes with 2 authentic southern sides of your choice, soup, salad, and rolls. It's a great price and great meal. You can get the still large, but smaller prime rib for $13.95. There's so much good food and large portions, I rarely finish it.  They also take Restaurant.com gift certificates. Our 2 large prime rib meals come to $35.00, and you get $25.00 off of that!! You can't go anywhere and have 2 big and complete prime rib dinners for $10!! Their other food is very good. I've had their crab cakes, chicken dish, and all their sides. Their sweet potato souflee is awesome. Green beans almondine, so good with the bacon. If you want to impress someone, take them here. The ambiance is classy, beautiful, yet you can dress casually. Use a restaurant.com here and your date or group will think you've spent lots of money, when in fact, it's very cheap. Their other meals range from $8-$15. They also have sandwiches, burgers, chicken, seafood, and pasta. I'm getting married in October and we're taking our wedding party here and out of state relatives. I'm getting a restaurant.com certificate - If we spend $150 (which we will with a large group), we get $75 off that bill !! This is a great place for quality food, a beautiful and romantic atmosphere, and cheap dining.  I'm giving this restaurant a price range of cheap because you can use a restaurant.com for lunch or dinner and the bill ends up being very inexpensive.

The mussels are so good, especially the sauce - I found myself almost drinking the tomato sauce with a spoon.  Others tried the thick slices of pastrami and loved it.  The shrimp, sold by the piece, is perfect.  My ribeye was a thin cut, pub style.  It was tasty although I prefer a good filet over a ribeye any day.\n\nInteresting thing happened:  My shrimp came and I grabbed the lemon - something thick and black on the lemon made a dark stain on my finger!  Smelled like grease or rubber.  The staff was quick to apologize and take it back to the manager.  I went to the nice bathroom (complete with attendant) and wash my hand.  When I came back, they had given me a fresh batch of shrimp and a couple of extras!  The manager came by and apologized again and was very nice to everyone.  I was impressed because a simple sorry would have been enough for me, but they made sure we were taken care of.  \n\nFinally, we briefly mentioned that we were getting married in several months.  At the end of our meal, out of nowhere, a couple of lit candles and some ice cream cookie sandwiches appeared on our table.

My worries of sweetness went away.  In fact, it was kind of faint but still bold enough to call it Sweet.  The Spicy aka Candied Jalapenos was just as light and noticeable.  If I was to order this again, I probably would prefer a little bit more heat! \n\nThe other two ingredients that worked superbly well were the tempura fried ratatouille and fresh, green watercress!  The buns also played a critical role in its overall taste.  It was lightly buttered, toasted and slightly burnt to give it texture and that smoky taste.\n\nThe only negative that stood out was in the patty.  While parts of it was semi-moist with some pink, the outer layer was evidently dry.  And actually, the fries was a bust, it was just too crispy and anti-fluffy.  No love on that.  Hence, a deduction of .5 stars!\n\nIf there's one gourmet burger that I could have a craving for, it would have to be this Sweet and Spicy.  The bar has a stylish, contemporary finish to draw the sporty, trendy crowds with plenty of alcoholic options on tap.

Several people in our group needed boxes to take their leftovers.\n\nService was a wee bit slow at times, but I am betting the management wasn't paying attention to the events, and didn't think they'd get a post 5k rush - listen up management, when Mandi wants a mimosa, she wants it NOW!\n\nIf they weren't so far away from me, I'd head back tonight to try out the steak, but that will have to wait for the next time I'm on the West side.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C_eWAEOvkHZ_IZYGwjtpmg"}

The good news is that when you finish dinner there are dozens of nightlife options in walking distance.

Its the morning after the biggest celebratory night of the year. The air is filled with alcohol and/or puke breath, walk of shamer(s) and hungover folk that either need to desperately jump on the booze horse with a Bloody Mary or desperately need some greasy food to survive the worst (and first!) hungover day of the year.\n\nNeedless to say it is a tough day for any brunch restaurant, but RnR managed to survive moderately well. \n\nArriving at the busiest brunch time ever, 11am, RnR gave us a little buzzer and told us the wait time would be approximately an HOUR. Since we figured everything would be packed, we decided to wait around and hope they would speed up the process. We went upstairs while we waited just because it was too cold outside and too busy by the bar. Unfortunately the staircases smelled like 3 homeless men had fought and died in their own pile of vomit and the RnR crew had forgotten to clean it up. Talk about disgusting.\n\nBringing in my \"fuck it\" mentality. We go to the patio area and find an empty couch in front of the TV. We figured we could chill out while we waited since no one was being seated there. Within minutes we had a server approach us and take our order. Score. Completely bypassed the hour wait and the buzzer. Me: 1, RnR: 0. \n\nThe outside location was perfect even for a freezing cold day: roof heater right above me, comfy couches and tables and the big flat screen right in front of me showing the Michigan game. Our server was super nice and diligent and for as busy as it was, he was sufficiently speedy. I ordered a sun dried and goat cheese scramble with house potatoes and toast. The scramble was decent (nothing to write home about) but lacked a bit of flavor/spice/basic salt and pepper. My latte came out cold but our server was nice enough to take it back and bring me a nice freshly-brewed one. My company didn't care for his breakfast tacos. I guess scrambled eggs in tortilla are not as foodgasmic as you would hope they would be.\n\nI get that RnR is more about the hang-out, clubby-music environment that Scottsdale brunchers aim for. Nothing wrong with that, I would just prefer my food to be a tad more elevated and for my staircases to be a tad less puke-y. I know, I'm such a picky bastard.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sbsFamEj5wDxNAjUKrMcSw"}

You broke my heart!  After 2 wonderful, memorable \"home-run\"  experiences in the past, I bring my family to share good times and brag on you...and YOU LET ME DOWN...BADLY!!  \n\nBefore arriving in Phoenix this weekend,   I learned though that the old Richardsons burned down but another \"sister\" restaurant \"Rokerij\" was serving the Richardsons menu.  I thought that's cool!\n\nI am sorry to say that this time, it was a MAJOR FUMBLE.  I don't think a restaurant has ever disappointed me like Richardsons or Rokerij (or whatever they call themselves\".  \n\nI ordered one of their blackboard special entrees of the day:  Sea bass encrusted in pine-nuts.  The waitress told me I could have either mashed potatoe baked in a half of a jalapeno, or I could have plain mash potatoes.  I chose the plain mash potatoes since I cannot eat jalapeno.\n\nMy husband (who is trying to go vegan) ordered the calamari entree salad.  \n\nMy son ordered the pastole soup and a BBQ chicken pizza.\n\nPast 2 experiences at Richardsons:  we were always served chips and salsa when we sat down.   This time:  no chips and salsa. \n\nSo, we ordered some.  we didn't get it for 15 to 20 minutes.  (And they charged us.)\n\nMy son was served his Pastole soup at the same time as the pizza, not ahead of the pizza.  That was odd.  Then when he started eating the pizza, it was not the pizza he ordered.  It was a plain feta cheese pizza, not BBQ chicken.\n\nMy husband's salad tasted bitter...my husband said he thought the lettuce did not taste fresh.  \n\nAs for MY entree, it was served about 10 minutes AFTER my family received their food.  AWKWARD!!  My son and husband didn't feel comfortable eating their dinner when I sat there with nothing (except chips).  When my entree finally arrived, it had the wrong potato...the one I didn't order...the one with the jalapeno green pepper...not the plain mashed potato.  Also, the pine-nut encrusted sea bass didn't look like it had any pine-nuts.  I wouldn't have ever guessed that there was a shred of pine nut associated with that fish.  So, I inquired and was told that just because it said it was encrusted with pine nuts doesn't mean that it would be covered with pine-nuts...it was supposed to be a \"dusting\".  \n\nIt was clear by this time,. we were having major problems with our dining experience.  I thought, this can't be the same Richardsons I remembered from the past.  \n\nThe waitress was \"busy\" and my husband went in search of the manager at the front of the restaurant.  He was in the middle of explaining the problem to the manager when the phone rang...the manager told my husband he had to take the call and my husband was just left standing there.   (Oh, really??  You interrupt a customer standing in front of you telling you about a service issue to take a phone call?)  My husband is a good sport and he waited and then continued to expalin the problem.  \n\nSome minutes later, the manager appeared at our table with the plain mashed potatoes.  As he served me the potatoes, he blurted out that \"I wasn't really supposed to get a choice of potato in the first place, since I was ordering off the Richardsons menu\".  (Recall the waitress gave me the option...I didn't ask for the option.  I didn't know what menu I was ordering off of...how am I supposed to know?) Is the manager actually telling  the customer that she shouldn't have gotten what they offered.  (OH REALLY??)  My husband explained then that the waitress had offered it.  Reply:  \"She wasn't supposed to.\"  (OH, DEAR! WHAT'S A CUSTOMER SUPPOSED TO DO!)  \n\nSo, in summary:  most of what COULD  have gone wrong at Richardsons DID:\n1)  Chips and salsa (I guess not offered to patrons complimentary anymore).   We requested them and were charged the $5...alright, I can pay for the chips.  It's just odd they don't offfer this anymore.  AND why did it take 20 minutes to get chips and salsa??\n2)  My husband's salad did not taste fresh.  Poor guy...he had his hands full trying to voice his concern to the manager about my meal and my son's and his wasn't right either!\n3)  My son's pizza:  they served him the wrong one.  Shouldn't the waitress be checking the order for accuracy before serving it??\n4) My son's soup wasn't served before the pizza.  So he has pizza and soup served at the same time.  Maybe the waitress could have asked if he wanted the soup before or with the pizza.  We thought it would come before.  (ASSUME NOTHING AT THIS PLACE!)\n5)  My mashed potato:  offered an option, served the option I didn't pick, then told by the manager that i shouldn't have had the option in the first place.  (JEESH!)\n\n By the way, the table next to us also had terrible service.  We overheard the waitress ask the patrons when they were asking for their check, \"Did you ever get the beer you ordered?\"  (DOESN'T SHE EVEN KNOW??)  \n\nAs stated before, I have experienced much better at Richardsons previously.  They should be embarrassed!!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IdnYOlL9aDfMu_S2kcaUkQ"}

This ingenious group of 3 guys who graduated from the CIA of Las Vegas decided to open their own business, riding on a popular trend of food trucks serving unique foods that was sparked up in the Los Angeles area.  My past experiences on these trucks were pre-made sandwiches, and tacos al-pastor (one of my favorites).   This truck only focuses on one type of food product...sliders.  Ricardo was one of the fellers that took our orders and told us about the food and their business.  That day the menu was limited to only three selections: the Pep-Pep, the Barbie, and the Pulled Porkie.  The wife and I decided to order all 3 choices and double up on the Pep-Pep.  My eyes could not stop gazing at the 4 sliders piled high with generous amounts of meat topped with light brown toasted puffy buns.   The Pulled Porkie was filled with layers of stewed juicy and tender pulled pork.  For the other burgers, I wanna say about  to 1/3 lb amount of ground meat cooked to about a medium, so the meat was very moist.  The Barbie was a burger that was covered with cheese and bacon , but was overpowered by the bbq sauce.. The Pep-Pep is what I wanted to focus my taste buds on  because it is the classic burger, the most simplest of them all the menu.  If someone can't make that right, then they don't know what they are doing at all.  \nThe verdict: the Pep-Pep was completely amazing.  When I sunk my first bite into this burger, my mouth felt the texture of the soft toasted bun, then the gooey cheese, and crispy thick bacon, and finally the moist burger.  My mouth lit up because I could actually taste how well seasoned the meat was and how the homemade thousand island, salty bacon, pepper-jack cheese, the lettuce, and tomato completed the whole slider, nothing was overpowering.  Since then, I have came back for more of the Pep-Pep, and looking forward to try the new items.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LnCbpxipUrA165zvfaePGw"}

And many different people can come here for different reasons. Note the suits at the bar - post-work drinks. Note the table of mummies with babies in the restaurant area - mid-week family lunches. Note the gaggle of girls in the corner giggling over a bottle of champagne - girls night out. Note the hushed couple in the corner canoodling over crafty cocktails and light bites -date nights. \n\nThe atmosphere, I would say, lends itself more to date nights and nights out, but it isn't exclusive despite this.\n\nWhat does it serve? Why everything. But does it do 'everything' well? (A hard feat). In fact, yes it does. A champagne and wine bar, it has many, many types of wine by the class, all different types of champagnes. But it also has a very creative cocktail list (a margarita with black pepper and..something else) which pack quite the punch. Fruity gimmicks these are not - The Bon Vivant know their cocktails.\n\nAnd quite possibly my most favourite thing about this bar is the nibbles and food menu. Where else in Edinburgh can you get little snacks for \u00a31? And really, really frickin' good snacks at that. They have a food menu that runs from 12noon to 10pm all day.

This wasn't calamari, or deep-fried. Oh no. Real octopus, fresh and cured the way you would find on the continent. My little bite of swordfish was delectable.\n\nThey also have a full menu of larger mains. So really, you can come here in any mood or having even not made up your mind and you're pretty much guaranteed to be satisfied.

My friend and I each had paninis and they were delicious. My Parma ham panini was fantastic with excellent mozzarella and tomatoes inside really good bread, but I was expecting slightly larger paninis or maybe a tad more salad on the side for the price.

Happiness was due a visit based on my mum recommending it from a previous visit - so I had high expectations, given her infrequent visits to the capital. And glad I am to, as it is the nicest Chinese meal I have had in a while, being it restricted to a dodgy takeaway or two. Enough to make you forget that given the right chef, this food can taste pretty good. \n\nInside, it looks like a takeaway place with a few tables and smells a little greasy. It's bright and cheery enough though and the bathrooms are much much cleaner than in some places I have visited recently. I was interested to note that it served much of the standard fare but mixed it with some more interesting and rarer dishes on the menu such as steamed dumplings and spare ribs in guinness sauce. I was intrigued by the salt and pepper tofu, although I didn't get to try it on this particular trip. \n\nUpon sitting down, you are given a bowl of prawn crackers. Now, I don't know about you but I love these heart-hardeners. The problem is - 90% of crackers I have sampled, taste of cack and are dripping with oil. Happiness delivers nice, thick crackers, full of fishy flavour and definitely less oily than the majority, thus renewing my faith that good crackers still exist in the world, you just have to seek them out.\n\nWe then plumped for the 8 quid menu, although there were many choices on the main menu to divert us. Pretty cheap, eh - and given that it was too close to payday for comfort, set menus seemed the best option. I had spring rolls while the boy had hot n spicy chicken wings - both cooked fresh to order and didn't appear to have the telltale traces of microwavery hijinks. The veggie spring rolls were particularly tasty, my only gripe being (and this is more general really) that you just can't find the giant spring rolls of yesteryear - if you did, the spring rolls here would be a perfect candidate for combining the four rolls offered into one. That would be all filler in this case (oh if only it were true). \n\nAs for the main course, the boy had Szechuan chicken, which disappeared almost in seconds, while I tucked into some delicious prawn with ginger and spring onions - all tasting delightfully fresh. The fried rice we had was also tasty and non-greasy. As our eyes were much larger than our bellies, we also ordered a side of salt n spicy chips - just to see what they were like. To report back - chilli-peppered chips are definitely for winners, although the chips themselves were not great, I would definitely attempt a similar dish at home. \n\nOverall the verdict is: seemed that food is cooked fresh to order, at least that is how it tastes. We both left very satisfied and reminded to never order bad takeaway again. Did we achieve happiness? Indeed we did.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zzUUj9BUNn0_0F5hwy7RRw"}

Speaking of which, why is this place attached to a boba store? \n\nThe ramen here is mediocre at best. I have had much better ramen both in the East Coast (Ippudo, Totto, etc.) and the West Coast (Daikokuya, etc.) within the same price range. The tonkotsu ramen, which apparently is there best seller, did not have any depth in the broth. The noodles were bloated/somewhat soggy and there additional sides were just awful (ex. What should have been menma (fermented bamboo shoots) was just plain hard bamboo cut up). Lets not forget the char siu, which I guess to them is non-roasted thinly sliced pork similarly used in Korean bbq. \n\nIn summary, yes this place is better than your $.10-$.25 bag of ramen, but $7-$8? I don't think so. I only came here since I frequent AZ for business and it was a chilly day which in turn made me crave something soupy.

I remember see this place come to the odd strip mall and thought it would never amount to nothing. I am pleasantly and utterly incorrect. Bistro La Bon is a culinary force to be reckoned with and has earned every bit of my palate's attention. \n\nFirst of all, these guys are making their own bread every day. For everything. making baguettes and brioche isn't easy to do when you have a shining menu to go along with it. It's labor intensive and has to be done right. Happy to say these guys deliver hand over fist with flavor. \n\nLove the decor, too. It's not to stuffy like some other French restaurants. It's small-ish, but the bar can seat quite a few people. Also, the waiting area is ridiculously comfortable. Try not to fall asleep here on a Sunday afternoon. Or do. \n\nBrunch is just amazing. Swedish meatballs, brisket, au gratin potatoes, salad, plenty of bread, chocolate waffles, eggs, bacon, and..... dun dun dun....the best freaking brioche french toast I've ever had in my entire life. This french toast is perfect. Simply perfect. Not overtly sweet. Just enough sweet/fermenty taste of brioche, modest amount of syrup, homemade whipped cream. It's grilled on the flat top with just the right amount of charred bits. Goodness. Save room for these as they can be ordered from your server. Get ready to eat a baker's dozen. \n\nThe service is fantastic. Knowledgeable and friendly. All you need. \n\nFor $18 a head, I have to say this rivals brunch from many other places in town.

My main gripe about this is that even though you've essentially already paid for the buffet, you still have to wait in line to get in. That makes absolutely no sense to me, I don't see why there's not some sort of express line or at least allow people with the wristband to enter through the diamond/platinum entrance. It seems borderline pointless to get this pass while waiting in the infamously absurd lines for the Rio, Paris and Planet Hollywood buffets. \n\nAlso, I really wish the pass was for 48 hours instead of 24. I originally intended to hit 3 of the buffets (Carnival World, which I omitted in place of Harrah's thanks to how frustrating the line was that night, Le Village at Paris and Spice Market at Planet Hollywood) and yet I only hit two thanks to an almost 3 hour wait at Paris (we got there at 1:00, didn't get in until almost 4:00). Not only were we both no longer hungry after finishing up but the line at the Spice Market was almost as bad as it was at Paris anyway. I think our game plan would have worked much better if we could have spread this out over 3 days, even in a period that's not as busy as Christmastime. Your stomach can only hold so much. \n\nI felt I did get my money's worth as the price of both of those buffets combined would have come out to be a few dollars more than the price of the promotion. The Harrah's buffet was pitiful, but Le Village more than made up for that and I definitely know I would go to the latter again, so I'll give the Buffet of Buffets that, but I will probably never do this again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ"}

Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.\n\nDespite my above comment, I only visited three of the buffets during my stay. (What can I say?

I ate at the Spice Market Buffet for breakfast, the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio for dinner, and the Paradise Garden Buffet for breakfast the following day. Out of those three, I found the Spice Market to be the best in terms of selection and quality. Although the buffets aren't as nice as the ones at, say, the Wynn of the Bellagio, you can certainly enjoy some nice meals for the price.\n\nI only have one complaint, which is that when we went to Caesar's Palace and asked an attendant where their buffet was, they replied that they did not have one.

I'm knocking my 5-star review down to a 3-star based on recent visits. I'm not sure what has caused the noticeable change, but the service has been pretty bad the last two times I've been there in recent months. And the food? Not what it used to be. This was one of my fave, go-to places in Charlotte (I'd recommended it a dozen times to friends, uptown coworkers, & out-of-towners), but no more. Even 3-stars seems generous at this point.\n\nFood took forever to order & receive both times. Orders were wrong. We never got any corn bread (despite asking for it twice!). Water refills were non-existent. Dessert was not impressive. It could just be me, but it appears they don't offer the same amount of side items anymore (or they've changed their variety to less healthy options that no longer appeal to me). And did their portions get smaller while their prices got bigger? Again, it could just be me. Or perhaps I'm more sensitive to the prices when the food & service are so disappointing.\n\nMy husband had visited a few other times for lunch and warned me, but I tried to stay optimistic and hoped he was wrong about the changes.

No, its not a coincidence that they're right next to each other and their signs look similar. But these restaurateurs do good work--I'm a fan of both!\n\nDATE ATMOSPHERE: Of all the Korean restaurants I've been to in Vegas, Soyo definitely has that 'cool factor' for a good date spot. The COOL part is in the booths on the back wall. They're constructed of wood and elevated off the ground. Very private and really gives the place this extra cool vibe. Lights are usually dimmed . And a blend of Top40 is playing that I approve of! Plus, you get to drink barley tea out of a copper tin bowl--offbeat ftw!\n\nPRICES:  Prices are a dollar or two higher than I would like, but hey! They're in a suburb area and super convenient. I don't have to drive to C-town to get some good Korean food if I have a craving!  Avg: $10-13 / entree.\n\nFOOD: I can't speak Korean. But I can read & understand all my food. My apologies in advance for my Konglish translations. I've tried a number of different things on the menu and they're all pretty good! I would definitely return. I can make 'Doenjang jjigae' (Soy Bean Paste Soup) at home and I have to say that Soyo's has a homemade flavor that I can appreciate. The' Yuk Gae Jang' (Spicy Soup w/ shredded beef, clear noodle, & veggie) could be a little spicier and more flavorful--but for people who can't handle their heat, this is a good thing. Pancakes are flavorful and crispy. But you really can't ruin fried food. One thing to try is the' Ddeokbokki'--rice cake sticks in a spicy sauce with veggies (get the seafood option if you like!) SWEET & SAVORY DELICIOUSNESS.\n\nPORTIONS: Soup servings are average and comparable to any other K eatery. But any other entree is HUGE. Even the \"appetizer\" stuff is pretty big. 1 entree/soup per person is more than enough. Be prepared to be absolutely stuffed if you order a 3rd dish to share. \n\nSERVICE: Polite & Prompt. Offered to refill side-dishes numerous times. Drinks were always topped off. And they didn't mind us hanging out to chill & talk after we were done eating.", "type": "review", "business_id": "G6mZKMiDqHDgH92IOg9QhQ"}

It is not as big as the Miami location, so the lounge/bar area is basically in the same area as the dining/eating area. \n\nGenerally, the LV STK is fun on Mondays for Industry Night, but people don't usually eat. It's more of a drinking, social event. To mix it up, we came to the LV STK with a group of eight people at 11:00pm on a Saturday night.

Unless you come before the music gets loud. \n\nThe hostess was fabulous, service was good, and the food was delicious.\n\nHere is why I knocked it two stars:\n\n1. There were middle-aged women dancing on top of the booths. That's fine in a nightclub, or even STK's lounge area, or even at someone else's booth who is ok with it, but they were dancing on top of our booth which was not ok. I was disgusted at the idea of sitting in the booth, while these women danced right where our heads were resting with their DIRTY, BARE FEET. Totally disgusting. I politely motioned to one of them and said \"Hi, this our table, we are sitting here\" with a smile. She looked at me and said \"So?!\" I was so surprised at this rude, middle-aged woman's response that I didn't know what to say for a moment. Luckily the hostess slid in and shooed them away, commenting how rude they were. Needless to say, it took a few cocktails for me to regain my appetite. If STK wants to promote a nightclub vibe do it where patrons won't be eating, or atleast impose some standards on who you will have up there dancing. Our party spent over $700 (food and alcohol) and for that money I don't want the experience of dirty, middle-aged Housewives-rejects dancing around my head as I eat.\n\n2. I ordered the 7 oz. filet mignon medium-rare. It arrived nearly well-done. No pink whatsoever.

When I'm at dinner, I like to be able to hear the people I'm sitting with.  It's ridiculous, even shouting my mother and I couldn't hear each other.  STK is a place \"to be seen,\" however it wouldn't hurt them to lean more towards restaurant and focus less on trendy.  STK, are you for pregame drinking or are you for fine dining?\n\nLuckily, I suppose, we just stopped in for a snack at the lounge area.  It's situated so you sort of have to be on the couch next to strangers-- but that's okay.  When the cocktail came around, we ordered the hamachi sashimi and beef tartare.  The food took a little while to come out, but it was busy so thats okay too.  \n\nThe music I can live with but the service was really why STK is 2 star to me.  The hamachi was good, nothing to rave about but still good.

YIKES it's not my fault you can't hear me, the music is really loud!  She took it back and we were promptly delivered tuna tartare.  Closer, but still wrong- we let her know and she kind of just walked away.  When she came back (we hadn't touched it) she asked us if we wanted to keep it... confused if she meant keep that instead or keep that also, we just said no just the beef tartare please.  Finally the beef tartare came out from an apologetic busser and it was like the hamachi, good but not the best.  Everyone in the lounge seats next to us had that supposedly amazing bread that everyone keeps yelping about.  Is it complementary?  We never received any... was it because she found us to be difficult?  I also ordered a beet salad to go.  When it says that it comes with arugula, it means a few sprigs.  I would call it more of a side order roasted beets.\n\nI would try STK again because I feel like I need to try some steak and that amazing \"complementary\" bread, but are they open for lunch?

It is located in a small venue, which had a very clean, simple and relaxing atmosphere.\n\nWe started with some appetizers and I would recommend getting the shrimp cakes, these things were so good I was tempted to just order that all night.\n\nThere were four of us and we ordered a Beef Panang (level 8 spiciness), chicken pad see-ew (no spiciness), basil crispy pork and chicken/beef pad Thai (level 8 spiciness).\n\nI'll start off by saying the curry and rice were the best together, the curry was spicy and it had a sweet tinge to it. The beef was soft and easily chewable. I just wish the green beans served would have been softer, I feel like they were undercooked. Other than that, the dish was excellent and highly recommended.\n\nThe pork was decent, reminded me of filipino liempo but the skin was sometimes unchewable. It was my first time having it so maybe it'd be worth another try.\n\nThe pad see ew was the spiciest, I could tell my nose was starting to feel it and it took two plates of pad thai to take away the burning sensation. I'd recommend going lower if you're not a fan of spice.\n\nThe pad thai was excellent and I'd recommend getting it. This is probably one of the stable Thai food all around, it never fails anywhere you go. In my opinion, the beef/chicken mix is great with any of these dishes.\n\nNext time I go here, I'd order the shrimp cakes, pad thai and curry.

If you like local grindz (Hawaiian food), definitely give this place a try. I ordered the mochiko chicken bento with kimchi fried rice, and whew I was struggling to get through it but I didn't want to stop eating. You definitely get what you pay for! \n\nI enjoyed the bento because you pretty much got to sample all the meats and had a choice of what type of rice you wanted. I will say that the chicken katsu was awesome. It had a crispy batter and moist inside so the chicken was not dry. Screw Raising Cane's, I think I'll go to Rice Trax when I have a craving for chicken fingers! The kimichi fried rice was also enjoyable but not as spicy as I would have liked, thank goodness for Sriracha! The teri beef skewer was tender and easy to eat! Sorry Mochiko but you were overpowered by Katsu!\n\nI would definitely be back to try some other combos. I do like the fact that it is a create your own fried rice. Yes you get charged for additional toppings outside of the 4 meat skewers & 3 veggies, and your own sauce but really who needs that many toppings? Plus for those that are health conscious, they do offer white or brown rice so that's always a plus! The decor isn't anything fancy or amazing so I would suggest take-out.

Just circle or fill in the bubble of what toppings, condiments, seasonings, etc. you want.

I told my PFGT, \"This is Ramen!\" Her Miso Ramen was just as good.  Needless to say, down to the last slurp of the broth, I would definitely go back!

I ordered it to go, took it home and began digging into it without really examining it.  I noticed some lumpy stuff, but just thought it to be clumps of rice and kept eating.  The sauce was flavorful, I was starving...and then my girlfriend asked if I was eating meat.  I realized then that the lumpy stuff was not clumps of rice or some other non-meat thing but rather some kind of unidentifiable meat.  I have never seen a non-vegetarian Ma Po Tofu before -- a dish that generally screams \"vegetarian.\"  Needless to say, I stopped eating immediately.  Unfortunately, I had consumed a good amount of food before realizing that it had meat in it.  Now it's time to settle back and hope that sickness doesn't come.\n\nI did have a spoonful of their \"vegetable\" fried rice.

More than enough for two people! We brought home leftovers. The accompany pita bread was fresh and warm. \n\nFor dinner we both ordered the Shwarma - it is their signature dish. Thin slices of broiled chicken and lamb. We had the choice of white rice, french fries, majadra (rice and lentils) or steamed broccoli. We both chose the majadra and neither of us were disappointed.\n\nAnyone that complained about service is a worry wort. Service was laid back. I think too many people are used to fast food restaurant chains that operate with in-your-face servers.

Something I doubt 95% of businesses food truck or not would do here in Vegas. It's usually just, nope, you didnt make it, come back when we are open or at this other location, Thanks! But not w Fuku. They had a very nice cool and professional staff that helped us order. The only downside, & what stopped me giving 5 stars was the price, and I know that is because the venue they were at, which I forgot I read about on Yelp from other reviews they have to cover overhead. We ordered 3 burgers, two Jazz fries, and 3 sodas and it was $39 & change. All burgers and fries were Delish, and awesome like other yelpers have stated. I know if I went to them at one of their regular spots would be $5-10 cheaper.

It isn't as good as my mama's cooking, but if I can't have that, then this will be a good substitution.  The restaurant seating area is small as in not many seats.  When I walked in, the smell reminded me of home =).  I was greeted by the waiter and he is Filipino, so I knew would be very helpful.  There is a section of the menu that is dedicated to 2 people as it is a set menu:  a seafood set menu and a meat set menu.  With some items on the menu you also have the option to try kamayan, which is eating with your hands.  Most of the couples in there (seems to be a popular place for romantic dates) went straight for utensils, but there was one couple that wanted to try it.  The waiter explained the technique (yes... there is a technique) and he did a good job.\n\nI started with the Lumpia Shanghai, pork eggrolls with a spicy sweet and sour dipping sauce.  Those were delicious, just like home.  I noticed my favourite dish on the menu, Sinigang na baboy, a tamarind based soup (sometimes called sour soup) with veggies and pork.  There is a small and a large size.  While the waiter said that the small size was like a starter and the large size was enough for two, I opted for the small size with a bowl of steamed rice.  He came out with a little box with holes at the top and candles inside, placed it on the table and placed a plate on it.  Now everyone was looking at me because I was the only one not ordering from the set menu.\n\nHe then came back with a bowl of rice and a bowl of sinigang.  He moved the plate onto the table and then placed the bowls of food on the box.  Clever idea!  When he said that the small portion was like a starter, he must've meant a starter for two because it was more than enough for me.  The rice was perfectly done (yes, I'm a snob about my rice).  And the sinigang was really good... only complaint was that some of the pork was a bit tough.  There were green beans, tomatoes, onions, and napa cabbage.  The broth was a little spicy, which was nice.  I did ask the waiter for patis, a fish sauce, to add a bit of salt to the broth.  They came through!\n\nI also decided to have dessert, usually I opt for Halo Halo or Ube, but because I don't see it on menus often, I went for the Bibinka.  The Bibinka wasn't quite what I am familiar with, but it was still warm and tasty.  And... all of that (I had water to drink) was under \u00a311.00.  I highly recommend this place (I walked 1.5 miles from my hotel to get there)... while it is authentic, it also provides a lot of dishes and even tutorials to help introduce people to Filipino food.

Order a pita wrap, combo, or a side of chicken breast and your favorite side and you're good to go.\n\nThe front counter order takers are inviting and friendly, and the head chef/owner is amicable. Service is quick, especially if you call it in ahead for pickup.\n\nThe chicken platter and sonoran chicken are both fantastic. The sonoran chicken has a great blend of southwestern flavors and the side of beans makes the meal. Chicken is never dried out; head chef knows what he's doing.\n\nDesserts (baklava and honey pudding) are simple, delicious, and authentic.\n\nSimple ingredients, simple atmosphere, and healthy outlook on food make this place a perfect choice for a quick lunch or dinner on a whim. We frequent here often.\n\nI only wish they had tabouli!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg"}

They put in more chicken than I thought they would, and the amount of veggies was just right.  I'd come back to try the curry, which is also popular.\n\nOne suggestion..

Word that they're back in business has spread quickly; when we arrived the waiting area was full and after we were seated 10 minutes later the line was out the door.  I returned the following evening with a friend and we were promptly seated.\n\nThe new location features a more modern and upscale look with a second floor for balcony type seating, but appears to offer less than half the capacity of the old space.  The layout seems somewhat awkward and cramped, especially the waiting area, which is basically a hallway situated between the foyer and bar.  However, the furnishings are very nice and appear to be hand carved, although they are quite bulky.\n\nThe first evening, I was expecting issues with food and service since they had only been open a few days.  It did take a while to be greeted by our server, but that's to be expected on a busy night anyway.  I ordered the Chile Relleno and a Dos Equis lager, and my better half ordered a combo plate with tacos.  She also loves guacamole so we of course ordered that too.  The guacamole was brought out within a few minutes, and the food shortly followed.  The Chile Relleno was awesome and plenty to eat.  The GF said her meal was also good, but indicated the beans had an unusual flavor.  I identified this flavor as \"smoky;\" I don't much care for beans anyway.  So, all in all, an excellent first visit despite my concerns about the recent reopening affecting quality of food and service.\n\nThe second evening, I had only expectations of a bomb dish.  I ordered the Chile Verde, and my buddy ordered a combo plate which I find boring because you can get tacos or what-have-you basically anywhere and they require no artistry in the kitchen.  The Chile Verde was solid, and although I would have liked more flour tortillas, I found it a very satisfying meal.  The server was consistently overly attentive, but she had only 2 tables and wanted to maximize her tips so I understood this and obliged.  For the second time, I enjoyed my experience at Matta's.\n\nI highly recommend Matta's to anyone looking for great Mexican food and solid service; I find them far superior to any of their well known competitors.  The only reason I didn't award a 5 was because I've only dined at the new location twice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qBc36uFI7orWS8NpYZCv_w"}

There is something about stepping out of a cold winter night into a warm friendly atmosphere that makes it more special than any other time of year, and Spoon's surroundings are very inviting indeed. Like I always do at a new place, I sat at the bar to chat with the bartender and whoever else happened by.\n\nEven being from the Southern United States, the hospitality masters, I have never felt more welcome than I did in Pittsburgh, and Spoon was no exception. Like every other place I visited in the 'Burgh, Spoon had friendly, warm inviting staff who couldn't wait to tell me more about their town and their restaurant. \n\nBesides hospitality, Spoon offers classy sophisticated environs and food to match. Without exception, every single course was excellent, well timed, beautifully plated, and expertly explained. Like many other restaurants in Pittsburgh, Spoon prides themselves on serving locally-grown and produced foods whenever possible, always a plus in my book.\n\nSpoon has the honor of having the single best breading that I have ever experienced in any restaurant, and I have eaten at Alinea in Chicago, The French Laundry in Yauntville and Alex in Vegas, three of the best restaurants in the United States. Spoon makes all their breads in-house (with the exception of the baguette but even that is locally made) and serve all of them hot, with whipped plugr\u00e1 honeybutter that you want to eat straight out of the ramekin.\n\nYou will experience a dill sweet corn muffin. This is a perfectly moist muffin. It is light and airy. It does not fall into the same trap that so many other muffins do of being dense. It compliments the meal and does not fill you up.\n\nThe cream cheese and chive biscuits are truly wonderful. A delicate, moist and perfectly sour buttermilk crumb holds sinful chunks of cream cheese hostage. I wanted to fill my pockets with these and take them back to my hotel room and mete them out throughout the week. They are that good.\n\nI ordered the tasting menu, since I wanted to experience the whole panoply of flavors and textures the restaurant had to offer. I try to do this whenever possible since I also have trouble making decisions when confronted with a menu where there are clearly no wrong answers.\n\nThe amuse-bouche was a fennel soup with house-made sausage and red pepper coulis. It was truly excellent with a smooth texture and a slight sweetness lent by the sausage. \n\nNext up was a yellowtail tuna sashimi with ponzu acids, a sesame vinagrette and seaweed salad. With fish dishes, it is often difficult to keep from overpowering the delicate flavor, but with this dish, the other elements complemented the flesh. This was a different take on sashimi and was as good as I've had anywhere.\n\nNext was a novel take on the breakfast classic of bacon and eggs. This was a crispy yet tender hunk of pork belly with a perfectly soft boiled egg. Hollandaise sauce and spinach accompanied. I want to make a special note of the Hollandaise sauce here. It was not heavy and goopy like many other specimens of this sauce have been for me. From what I understand, this is a difficult thing to accomplish, but Spoon did it wonderfully. This was my favorite course, and I could eat this every day of my life and be blissful.\n\nAnother fish dish: Black cod miso with hot and sour mushroom broth and pork belly dumplings. Miso black cod is one of my favorite seafood dishes. I've had it at many superb restaurants such as Tomo in Austin and Nobu in Vegas. Highly touted Nobu actually comes in third here, with Spoon taking the title. This was truly superb. As a side not, it iis rare when one encounters perfect broccoli, but this dish included it as a side. The cod had a perfect texture as well; not mushy at all yet it yielded with ease to teeth and tongue.\n\nThe first beef course followed: Fillet and short rib. The small fillet hunk was cooked to a perfect medium-rare over a small arugula salad with goat cheese (always a winning combination). The short rib was (I believe) sous-vide to perfection, served with braising sauce. This cut of meat is always a winner, and not particularly difficult to do well, so I was not surprised at its excellence. It was served over potato-garlic puree, which hit all the right notes and sang the right song.\n\nI did not write notes on the dessert, but I remember it being a wonderful chocolate concoction of some sort that was very good. I did opt for coffee afterward. It was an excellent roast served in a small french press with its own setting. It was very classy and served as a wonderful finale to the experience. \n\nDuring this last ap\u00e9ritif, I had a wonderful conversation with a gentleman at the bar. But given the rest of my meal, and the rest of my Pittsburgh experience, that didn't surprise me either.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-Mh44q324VW8mpxIdH_HPw"}

Then a little rice cake to soak up the sake juices with just really made this the perfect dish.  \n\nDessert Course:\nArai Pastry Japanese Desserts- Three desserts from Arai Bakery in Tempe that were a perfect way to finish the meal.

You can also opt for baked or grilled chicken and add vegetables for a lighter fare.\n\nThe side of fries was a heaping size. They topped off an entire to-go container.

Upon walking into Lucky Strikes it struck me that it didn't feel like a bowling alley but rather a huge roomy club. The music was happening, there was a dj by the side bar/lounge and as you walked up the stairs/ramp it led you to a cavernous room where the bowling lanes were situated as well another bar/lounge area and two billiard tables. The overall atmosphere and decor of this place makes it a go-to destination and something central Phoenix really needed. Anywho, my friend reserved two lanes for 120 minutes, each lane was $49.99/hr and she included us in a drink package of unlimited beer and wine for $22 excl tax. let's say the unlimited drinkage helped my bowling game or lack thereof. I've never felt that pro-ish, the tipsiness really gave me courage to give it my all! liked the dj, it was a healthy mix of dance ripped top 40 with old school hip hop... it really lent a true party experience to my friend's birthday bash as well as the overall vibe of the place. BUT one thing that annoyed me with lucky strikes was the music volume, it was LOUD! now, don't get me wrong I go out to the clubs in old town and I'm used to LOUD but a club with friends is not a conversation/social experience, albeit social but i go out to the clubs to drink and get my dance on. But at a bowling alley during down times like waiting for your turn, drinking your beer, there are times you might like to chat with your friends but with the music volume, it's too loud that you spend the time nodding your head and agreeing to something you did not hear =( and it ends up being a shouting fest like, \"What?!? you said what?!? huh? No... i did not buy this shirt from..., OH you said you like my shirt?! ok!! thank you! (other person - what?!?) give up, thumbs up!\" \n\nOh, food wise well it's upgraded bowling alley food with presentation if there's such a thing. lol. we ordered a basket of Parmesan herb fries $7.5 which was a large basket and the mac & cheese bites $6 which were quite bland but cheesy and was a good serving size. Overall, I liked the place, it's a great place for a birthday and everything is professional and appealing. Oh and don't forget to get your parking validated before you leave, it HELPS!", "type": "review", "business_id": "_OYlq2UoKPQO_ElqhC3a8w"}

They have it split up into Indo-Manchurian, South Indian, and a few other categories like veggie, lamb, chicken, etc.\n\nI came with two other people and we ordered samosas, two kinds of naan (rosemary and regular), chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, and an eggplant curry dish.\n\nThe naan and samosas were delicious.  The guys loved their chicken dishes, but my eggplant entree was a little short on eggplant and was pretty much a bowl full of sauce.  Hot, delicious curry sauce--so I still ate most of it anyway, just scooping it up with the naan. \n\nWe also shared a bottle of wine.  It's BYOB with no corkage fee, so that's a definite plus.  The minus is that they are slooooooooooow with water.  Come on, people!  I ordered an \"8\" on the spice scale!\n\nThey were also painfully slow in bringing the check.

We got to the restaurant at 7:15, were done eating in an hour, and didn't leave until after 9.  What?!  It's kind of a laissez-faire waiting style, similar to what you'd expect in a French cafe.

Open face turkey sandwich, tuna melt, all the variations of loaded fries, the big holla (it's like a grilled cheese on steroids), breakfast... I've never had anything bad here. During our latest trip here, my friend Andrea got the cheeseburger wrap. It looked incredible. I will definitely be ordering that during my next visit. \n\nWe also discovered something new on this latest adventure to Mattie's: Chrissy's Buffalo Chicken Dip. Reido talked about this the entire drive to the Diner. When we got there, the rest of us were distracted by a mini cooper outside filled with stuffed animal dogs (I'm confused too... some kind of contest promotion). Not Reido. He went right inside and ordered the dip the minute he sat down. It was delicious. I think the best part of it is the homemade pita points that come with it. I could eat those by themselves.\n\nA long list of shakes, malts and floats. I try to save room for these, but I tend to eat way too much food. These also have a fried oreo sundae. The only thing that can make an oreo even more delicious is to fry it. \n\nThe service is quick and friendly. There's one super sweet server that I swear must be there every single hour of the day.

After experiencing a wonderful meal there, complete w/ terrific saffron-rosewater ice cream (with wafer cookies!!), Mom and I wished I'd bought three (the max offered)!  \n\nIt's a a step or two up from being a dive, but I was completely ready to get an earful from Mom-- I DIDN'T, which still surprises me now just thinking about it.  I immediately looked up at the wall menus to see what Mom and I would like , while Mom sat at the table sulkily flipping over the paper menu.  I decided on trying the steak kabob wrap, while I chose the lamb kabob platter for Mom, especially when I saw that it included saffron rice.\n\nAs we sat waiting for our food, we noticed that it was very cold in there due to all of the ceiling fans running on full blast.  I had to retrieve my sweater from the car so that Mom could stop shivering.  I didn't think it was necessary to have all the fans on, but I didn't complain.  \n\nWe were ooh'ing and aah'ing from our first bites!  I haven't seen her so happy w/ a meal out for a long time...  I couldn't try the lamb (allergy), but her plate looked delicious, w/ a huge skewer of tender lamb cutlets, perfectly grilled, a generous serving of saffron-sprinkled basmati rice, a roasted tomato, and onions.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=uX1Sejv2TWyKlx_uQqI3QQ#uX1Sejv2TWyKlx_uQqI3QQ  Adding more veggies would've made the platter better, but Mom really was happy w/ her meal.  I loved my steak kabob wrap-- the steak chunks could've been a little less fatty, but they were tender and juicy.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=AorqavIoTJg5u_lISQ42hg#AorqavIoTJg5u_lISQ42hg  I wished there were more pieces...  I'd ordered the wrap instead of the platter, bec. I wanted the bread, but I kept wishing there were more veggies in my wrap, so I'll have to try the platter next time and just order a pita on the side.\n\nWhile the entrees were delicious, it was the homemade ice cream that stole the show!  It's listed as \"Saffron ice cream,\" but it also contained rosewater, tiny chunky pieces of almond paste, and pistachios. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=ucKC5wE-qiNW6g_Cz1TdJw#ucKC5wE-qiNW6g_Cz1TdJw  It was PERFECT!  I was very tempted to buy a pint to take home, but it's so delicious, I didn't want to binge on the stuff!  It's an excellent ending to a terrific meal.  (We would go back just to have this- it's that good!)\n\nZaytoon was a bit price-y, especially w/ its cafeteria-style atmosphere- Z's certainly not a place you'd like to take a date to!  Spiffy up the place a bit, Z!!  However, we'll be back, w/ or w/o a groupon!\n\np.s.

I can't speak for how it tasted but that disappeared quickly as well.\n\nI think Plaisirs Coupables with its hip d\u00e9cor, attractive and attentive waitstaff, and solid food is a great option downtown for lunch.

They should really call this place \"Club Canteen\" because I really got the Scottsdale club vibe from the decor, people, music and staff of this place.  Anyway, I didn't let that deter us so we gave the hostess our name to be put on the 45 min waiting list to get a table.\n\nAfter walking around mill for 20 mins we went back and took a seat at the bar.  The bartender was very nice but the margaritas are just ok.  They do have TONS of tequila choices if that is your thing so they weren't lying about the \"tequila bar\" in their name.\n\nThey gave us a table in the time promised.  We were seated outside in the back and in the dark.  It was kind of ridiculous that there were no lights out there and we could barely see the menu.  Between that and the loud dbag techno music I really felt old.  Anyway, here is what we had:\n\n* chips and guacamole - the chips were great but the guac was too pasty and may have been from some sort of package.  It tasted ok but it wasn't what I expected from a \"Mexican\" food place.\n* steak skewer lettuce wrap things - these were pretty good and unique....little skewers with tender pieces of steak which you slide off into lettuce wraps.\n* Corona And Lime Roast Chicken - this was very good and flavorful\n\nThe service was just ok.  It was just too busy with drinkers too get decent service.  It was like having dinner at a club.\n\nAnyway, this place seems better than it really is.

It doesn't look like much from the outside, being that it's in a strip mall that doesn't incorporate the use of eye-catching logos, but once you walk through the door, you're transported to a quaint, modern coffeehouse atmosphere.  It felt like a place where you could hang out and talk with friends for awhile, especially with the big living room set up.  \n\nWe ooh-ed and ahh-ed over the display case of pastries and cupcakes.  I knew I wanted something substantial for breakfast, though, besides pastries, so I went with the egg sandwich, as that was basically all there was.  I ordered it with one of Sunflour's giant cheddar biscuits and was very glad I did.  The biscuit was phenomenal.  It really turned an ordinary sandwich into something extraordinary.  My partner wasn't crazy about the interior, though.  He commented that both the egg and cheese felt processed (even though I imagine they're not since they use organic and/or local ingredients).  Perhaps that's an opportunity for Sunflour?  Make the egg a little less processed looking and use a more unique, flavorful, chunkier cheese.  \n\nOn the side, we also split a homemade fig bar.  It was a good size for sharing and was very sweet and tasty.  I loved it.  The chai latte was delicious as well.  \n\nI definitely want to go back to Sunflour.

Every room is different - a mish mash of tables and chairs in one spot, then around the corner there's couches or mats for sitting on the floor, and the beauty of it is it works. Yet, there is a consistency in flow and feel here. \n\nIt's very easy to strike up a conversation with randoms in there. There's lots of natural lighting and candles.\n\nThere's also live bands playing every night I believe. (Check the website to be sure). \n\nLiterally 2 mins walk from Berri-Uqam metro, if you're in Montreal you must drop by this place. In many ways it's representative of the relaxed and welcoming feel of the city and its people that I've come to love.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wvFlOhqA_oSzbY6ZIAprWQ"}

I stumbled upon it through a top 100 list of Vegas online a couple of years ago.  Anyway, I have been frequenting Patisserie Manon every 2-3 weeks since then, as it is located in the Summerlin, Boca Park area.  I have been on the hunt for a bakery that can rival this  place; but alas, I have failed countless times. \n\nNow to the food.  Of course, their macarons are just schlamazing! My favorite is the salted caramel!  One of the cakes I enjoy most is the Frazier, which is this white cake, covered in thin, roasted slices of almond on it's perimeter, and has slices of strawberries between the three layers of delicious fluff.  Yum!  Most of the dessert items have one thing in common: having the right amount of sweetness.  It could be that this is something intended in French cooking.  Regardless, it's good and you can bet that the pastry chef know what he or she is doing. \n\nI've also ventured a bit deeper into the bakery, where their hot foods are made to order.  The quiche lorraine is my favorite.  I believe it has bacon and cheese (it's been a while since I've ordered it).  Their boeuf bourguignon is scrumptious.  The slabs of beef and slices of carrot are so tender.  The soup is so delicious. It's also served with a baguette, because this dish wouldn't be complete without you dipping it into the sauce with the trace of bergundy wine all up in there.  I'm hungry now. \n\nOverall, this is an impeccable establishment and I highly recommend visiting this place, even if you are just visiting Las Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Y2BXS2OOrlMSYfS5xdjtmw"}

I haven't sat down to a real breakfast in approximately eleven years.  I have never been one to just roll out of bed and go, \"Pancakes sound amazebeans!\"  Had I been served some Yoli's Hawaiian french toast in my younger years, that might have changed my mindset in my adulthood.\n\nA few days ago, that pesky rascal named Brett B. texted me to rally up the Lunch Bunch for some Yoli's Cafe.  I must live in a cave because I never heard of the place.  After some strategic texting back-and-forth where a group-text probably would have been a wiser choice, it was set that we were going to meet up for brunch.  Being the OCD individual I am, I spent the next few days scouting the online menu and creeping on Yelper pictures of the joint.  \n\nTime-jump to yesterday, Friday at 11:30am.  Finding this place was slightly tricky and locating a parking spot was even trickier!  Nonetheless, we all arrived on time and sat down to be served by the most amusing and friendly waitress ever.  She's so friendly, outgoing, and personable.  I wanted to put her in my pocket!  This lady's a hoot!  I ordered a Mornin' Monte after being told the difference between that and the Monte Cristo [one has egg whites in place of ham].  Best decision ever.  \n\nThere was turkey, crispy bacon, egg whites, and Havarti cheese sandwiched in between the most perfectly grilled Hawaiian french toast with spicy orange marmalade and syrup on the side.  Although it's french toast, I opted not drowning my french toast with the syrup.  It would be much too sweet and strong on top of all that powdered sugar goodness.  Instead, I had spread a modest layer of spicy orange marmalade onto every bite.  It was bliss.  The lovely Ms. Yoli saw me sharing with my lunch companions and gave me an extra marmalade.  Totally sweet of her!  I ended up taking half my sandwich home which I tucked away a few hours later straight out of the fridge.  Still delicious, still amazing.\n\nSo now I sit here daydreaming of a delicious Mornin' Monte for breakfast and wishing I could eat it every day.  Of course, I'd probably end up packing on the pounds but hey, who needs vanity when you can have Monte?", "type": "review", "business_id": "kfscAJnLVf6J2uEte7g-5A"}

On the second trip, we had sweet & sour chicken and I'd say it was just as average as the pork was.  Other new dishes were:\n\n- Seafood Fire Pot: this was quite good, but I doubt I'll order it again.  There was a generous portion of lobster, scallops, and shrimp (for $11, anyway), but it was a little too bland.\n\n- House Lo Mein: this dish pretty much rocked.  The noodles weren't soggy, and it wasn't too greasy either.\n\nThis place has a fairly extensive menu.  And, the lunch combo prices look unbeatable.  For under $5, you get soup, egg roll, crab pubb, fried rice, and your entree.\n\nThe atmosphere is very casual, and the service reminds me of a good San Francisco Chinatown dive.  Not exactly a good date restaurant, but great for a date between the red bbq spare ribs and your stomach.\n\nDefinitely keep this place in mind for take-out.

I wasn't really coming in with any expectations, as we were just looking for a place to have dinner in the Cosmo, but we're fortunate to have chosen this restaurant.\n\nWe were seated next to the window in a fairly empty restaurant.  I don't really care about the strip view anymore, but I will say the window seat overlooking the strip is great.  As long as you don't mind staring at giant signs of Britney Spears across the street, you should be ok.   Try to get it if you can.  The place in general is classy and refined - not to mention the dining room is in the back- so it's a good choice for a date or family celebration.\n\nThe bone marrow with oxtail jam is definitely the jam.  Lots of oxtail.  It was probably my favorite part of the meal.  Order it for an app.  I got the steak special and it was yuuuugge.  I barely finished half of it, but it was prepared to a perfect medium rare.\n\nI tried the scallop dish and those were pan-seared to greatness as well.  It came with piquillo peppers, foraged mushrooms, and oxtail gratin.  Maybe they have a farm in the back that cultivates mushrooms, or they go mushroom hunting in the mountains, in order to call them \"foraged\".  Whatevs, it was tasty.\n\nDrinks were well-crafted, and I hear they're cheaper during HH. I'd assume that's a pretty good value deal.\n\nI used a foursquare special to get a free dessert.  It's been a looong time since I've seen a 4S special of that quality.  We used it to get the Devil's Food Cake (pralines and milk chocolate ice cream) and it was awesome.  Like stupid awesome.  Definitely take advantage of this if you can!\n\nService was a little slow but it was no big deal, as we were in no rush.

The Shipwreck (namesake of the manager) is crazy good... with truffle aioli and gruyere cheese. Mouthwatering. The fries are pretty awesome too, fresh cut, and always crispy. It's a pretty good atmosphere for the restaurant's purpose. Being a burger joint in downtown, I would assume most business is for lunch. It is always packed, with a line out the door. If you can find a seat at the bar the over looks the kitchen, you get your burger handed to you wrapped in paper. No plates, eat yer meat, have some friendly conversation with the manager, and get on back to work or use your time to walk around the city. Take-out is a popular option there, as food is ready fairly quickly (unless you are one of those jerks that likes your delicious fresh ground meat burger well-done). The people who work there are always friendly... willing to joke and talk if you do find a seat at their bar.

Located in the heart of Mile End, Lawrence serves up Canadian bistro classics with a French flare. \n\nThe food itself changes rather frequently and the menu features fresh (local, where possible) ingredients. Last night I had the pork chop with braised radicchio and mustard fruits. The pork was so succulent and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Pork can be so overcooked, dry and bland that I often avoid it at all costs when ordering at a restaurant. But a friend of mine recommended the fatty (in the best way possible) incarnation that they serve at Lawrence and I was not at all disappointed. \n\nMy boyfriend had the braised octopus and he said it was also perfectly cooked. Octopus is a funny fish to cook and many many chefs have a hard time avoiding the 'rubber factor,' where octopus inevitably comes out chewy as all hell, reminiscent of jaw-breaker chewing gum. Such is not the case at Lawrence where the food artists in the kitchen are well versed on cooking seafood. Our party of 10 guests had most of the items of the menu and some of the other fan favourites included Striped bass (again, the seafood!) and bay scallops and potato cake on the appetizer menu.\n\nLawrence is also a great place to drink; the wine menu--red, white, and rose--is extensive and the serving staff are more than happy to suggest some perfect pairings. In a departure from my usual ordering of a dry white or pinto grigio I opted for a beer on tap (en fut). The Blonde de Chambly was just the kind of beer I was looking for--not too bitter but rather a light beer with a citrusy flavour intermixed with an almost honey-like sweetness.  A really nice--and award winning--option for all those diners sick of the usual wine options. In terms of cocktails where were a number of satisfied drinkers in our party. The whiskey sour was probably one of the best I've here had--hands down. And I am connoisseur of whiskey sours! Ha! \n\nThe decor--for all you foodies who also love indulging in fabulous decor--was really creative and on-point. The wallpaper in the washrooms and the industrial-chic touches paired with more traditional pieces creates a really pleasant space in which to dine. \n\nJust a note about the staff--the service was flawless. I had originally made reservations elsewhere but our party grew to an unwieldy 10 people and we needed to switch locations. I called on a Saturday afternoon for reservations and the crew at Lawrence made it work for us! While dined rather late--10pm--it was totally worth it and I will be forever grateful for their accommodating efforts. \n\nGO! You must! Its one of Montreal's finest.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dfgENBCAfScTV-iA7sEDmA"}

We were not disappointed. \n\nWe were quickly greeted and seated upon arrival.  We started our journey with the pretzel fondue and panko zucchini.  The pretzel fondue was very delicious.  It consists of small soft pretzel bites with mustard and queso sauce for dipping.  While did not try the panko zucchini, others in our party said it was very delicious.  \n\nThey have some pretty good beers on tap.  However, our server wasn't very knowledgeable about their beers.  I landed on the Four Peaks Raj.  It was very tasty.  \nFor my entree, I had the truck stop burger.  It was awesome.  The burger is a 1/2 pound patty with cheddar, Swiss and American cheeses topped with bacon, a fried egg and Tabasco aioli.  It is basically a heart attack on a bun but man is it worth the risk.\nThe others in my party decided on the fish n' chips (very adventurous I know).  They were all very happy with their selection.\n\nSo why only 4 stars?  I feel the wait staff could have been more knowledgeable and more attentive.  They seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  The food was excellent so I will definitely give them another try when back in town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qRBeZAFiId0ainBtpFSGuQ"}

The place itself was quite huge with three different seating areas (the bar, main dining, and private rooms). The staff was nice overall and service was prompt because every server pretty much helps out each table. I know this may not seem like a huge factor but I liked it. \n\nWe ordered the pretzel and fondue which seems like a hit for everyone. it was good no doubt, but you would prolly get sick if you ate too much of it. As for the main course, I had the King crab cioppino which was excellent! Gf had the short rib stew which was also excellent. We polished those dishes until it was clean and was full with satisfaction. \n\nDrinks were on the okay side. I had an old fashioned which was kinda watered down.

As much as I thought I was going to love this place, I have to say that I was sadly mistaken.\n\nLet's start with the service.  Our waitress was friendly but probably annoyed once she realized we weren't going to be spending the big bucks like a lot of the other patrons of this restaurant.  She tried so hard to upsell me to get a glass of wine that once she discounted the price I finally caved.  I got it more or less so that she would quit asking.  Other than that, she was friendly enough and attentive.\n\nMy husband and I had thought about going the one appetizer and one pizza route (to not be pigs), but when I saw that there weren't any vegetarian appetizers we decided to just get two pizzas.  We ordered the Margherita Roman style (thin and crispy) and the Quattro Formaggi Neapolitan style (chewy crust).\n\nOur pizzas came out quickly and looked really good, but after a few bites I wasn't very impressed.  For starters, I'm not sure if it's the cheese or if they add olive oil, but our pizzas were dripping in grease.  The Roman style was a little too crispy for me (and I love thin crust) and the Neapolitan was soggy in the middle.  The flavors of the Margherita were good, but the Quattro Formaggi could have used a little less cheese and maybe some type of sauce to break up the flavor.\n\nDespite thinking we were going to leave full and with leftovers, we ended up eating it all and had room for more.\n\nWhile the two ovens is an interesting concept, there are other places I'd rather get a pizza that cost less, and more importantly, tastes better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RFqDK2b5mpasIuAzDoDdDg"}

T-Town should come with a disclaimer: \"The city of Tucson lacks 4 and 5-star Chinese restaurants.\" I've been hunting around for a while now, and then on my first attempt at Chinese in Phoenix, I experience a satisfying victory.\n\nFor Americanized Chinese food, this place is freaking good. They have $8 dinner combos for the win, which come with a super-portioned dish, a spring roll, and two crab cakes. The crab cakes are delicately formed as bite-size pieces of art, with crisp upward facing wings. Fresh-fried bites of love with a comforting, creamy, white inside. The spring rolls are likewise fresh-fried. They have a juicy inside and a wonderfully flaky outside. Mm. And the General Tsao's is (a) huge, HUGE (portion) - too much for one person, even if said person has a hefty appetite. It's not as saucy as hubs prefers, but it sure is tasteful. Like so many other places, the chicken is tenderly excellent, while it's breading is slightly too saturated (missing the crispy oomph).\n\nI especially appreciate Asian Island's transparent kitchen wall, which allows guests to peek in while the cooks do their thang.

When I heard about the grand opening last Friday, some friends and I planned to have dinner there on Sunday.  Sadly, they were closed.  But we found out their hours and a friend and I went there today for lunch.  In short, it was worth the wait!\n\nLunch service at Umami is pretty different from dinner service, or so we were told.  We were seated right away, brought menus, and told to order up at the bar and they would bring us our food.  \n\nWe decided to go with the trio of foods - dumplings, salad and ramen for $13.  It was a really great deal.  I ordered the Umami Mushroom Arugula salad, Veggie Dumplings with smoked tofu, bok choy and shiitake mushrooms, and Tonkotsu Ramen (pork ramen with egg, roast pork, bamboo shoots, nori and green onions).  \n\nThe mushroom salad was delicious - shiitake, baby portabello, button mushrooms, red onion, cucumber and cherry tomatoes.  Very fresh greens and vegetables, and the trio of mushrooms were very flavorful.  I loved the sesame soy dressing on this salad.  All of the salads sounded good, so I'm looking forward to trying others.\n\nThe dumplings were my favorite part of this meal.  I was surprised to get a whole tray of 6 dumplings with my order!  And let me tell you - the dumplings were amazing!  They had the perfect pan-fried crust on the bottom, the dumpling was soft and chewy, and the flavors inside really melded together well.  When I ordered, I was recommended a specific dipping sauce, and I heartily agree that the pairing of the spicy soy sauce with the veggie dumplings was spot-on.  My friend had the pork and chive dumplings with a different sauce, and you could really taste the chive and ginger.  Delicious!\n\nSadly, the ramen was only okay for me.  The roast pork and egg was delicious, but I wasn't too excited about the broth.  The broth was a little bland to me, but then I tend to really love bold flavors.  If the broth was just a little bit richer in pork flavor, it would have made for an excellent bowl of ramen.  Still, the other ingredients - the locally produced noodles, the egg, the nori and the green onions - stood out for me.  The bamboo shoots were a unique flavor, but tasted a little bitter to me.  It's probably more the type of bamboo shoot.  \n\nThe service was very friendly, but a little unobservant at times when my water glass needed refilling and no one was around.  But the owners are very nice, and they are still getting things finalized.  They did a great job with the atmosphere and the interior.\n\nI definitely want to go back for dinner to try out some of their cocktails which I hear are some of the best and most unique in Madison.  I also want to try out some of their other dishes and appetizers because everything sounds so good.  Overall, I give Umami 4 out of 5 stars, and who knows?  That may change to 5 after a few more visits.  :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "tCYKZXzVg2zBAzmprrZt-g"}

It's located in The Westin and has a beautiful, serene patio/dining area...well, at least until we got there.  The restaurant was empty.  At 7:30 p.m. I was concerned that we weren't going to get in but lo and behold, we had the patio to ourselves.  \n\nThe service was wonderful, probably due to the fact that we were alone in this place.  Our hostess suggested we sit by the beautiful fire pit and enjoy our cocktails, which we did.  Our sever suggested we order at the pit and that they would come get us when the food was ready to be delivered.  What service.\n\nFood.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it took so long to get our food.  However, it was worth the wait.  I ordered the goat cheese fondue (which is more of a dip), the beet salad and the crab cake.  Others ordered the beef filet, lamb chops and chicken.  Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted superb.  We enjoyed a beautiful evening with a very attentive staff and wonderful food.

I'm glad I did.\n\nSince I was alone, I opted to sit at the bar.  Besides not taking up a table meant for two or more, I often have a good time watching the bartenders do their thing.  In this case, I had a direct view into the small kitchen of this restaurant and I could see Chef Pellegrino's sister, Chef Alessandra Madeira, cooking with her staff.  The kitchen seemed to run well and there were some laughs coming from there.  They were also putting out a good number of meals.  There were several take out orders called in while I was there.\n\nThe three course Restaurant Week menu has a lot of choices.  For the starter, I chose the Polpette Tradizionale--two 6 ounce meatballs made with beef, pork, and veal in a fresh tomato and basil sauce.  What a large starter.  That could have been the meal.  The sauce was very good and the meatballs were soft in texture and had an excellent flavor.\n\nFor the main course, I chose the Salsicce and Pepperoni--Italian sausage, both hot and sweet, saut\u00e9ed over red and yellow peppers and onions.  Another winning dish.  The onions and peppers were saut\u00e9ed just enough to start to soften them but not enough to take some of the crispness away and turn them to mush.  The pieces of sausage were cooked nicely and were very tasty.  It was different to have the sausage served in bite sized pieces and I liked the main course a whole lot.  I did let some of the peppers go.  Can't fill up on fiber!\n\nFor dessert, I had ordered then Torta di ricotta--classic Italian ricotta cheesecake.  After having had ricotta cheesecake at several Italian restaurants recently, I am convinced that it's the only way cheesecake should be made--with ricotta and not cream cheese.  The texture of the ricotta cheesecake was excellent and the cheesecake was a perfect way to end the meal.\n\nService throughout was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without having to ask.  One of the bus people removed any finished plates.  The staff worked as a team and they worked well together.\n\nA few notes:  If you arrive in the early evening, don't think they're not open.  There are wraps on the windows to shade the sun which the restaurant faces much of the day.  The restaurant itself is a small space, cozy, with interesting decorations including the clothes hanging from the line over the doorway area.  \n\nThis was a grand way to start Spring Restaurant Week.  I hope my other choices turn out this well!  A hearty thanks to Chef Madeira and the staff at Bratalian for a very pleasant dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tZCIC-GWGYS7yh3KVbRnlw"}

The decor is quite entertaining including lots of nautical chotchkes that put you in the mind of a beachside seafood shack.\n\nFor lunch I was able to try both the special salmon taco - delicious with a tasty sauce - and the fried shrimp taco, which was also very good. The jalepeno cheddar cheese grits souffle was awesome and should not be missed. Many of the other side options look like great choices as well, especially the cactus salad which I didn't yet try.

Not to say you can't get a genuine feel for a place after 1 visit, more like there are so many places I frequent that I haven't reviewed and I feel those fully-realized thoughts would be more beneficial to Yelp readers.  But upon leaving Carlos' Kitchen, after just 1 visit, I felt compelled to chime in and share this gem with locals sooner rather than later.\n\nOne of the reasons I feel comfortable reviewing Carlos' is that every other positive review of this place is already spot-on.  YES, Carlos was there and came to visit my table (at 9:30pm on a weekday, despite an otherwise empty dining room) - a classy, genteel, respectful move if there ever was one in the restaurant biz.  YES, my food was hot to order, well presented, plentiful, and above all, delicious.  YES, there is always multiple specials of the day, your server will describe them in precise detail, and it won't be a scam like Cream of Yesterday's Entree Soup. YES, the place is a poker bar with scant distance from the smokey bar to the seating area, but once the food starts landing all that melts away.  And YES, the prices are far more reasonable than they have any business being (Hot app, sandwich, special-of-the-day dinner salad, and 2 soft drinks came in under $40, even after tax/tip,).  \n\nSo what else do I want to add to this conversation that hasn't already been said?  Thanks for asking, I'll tell you...\n\nCarlos' Kitchen looks like a Timbers, a PT's, a Lodge, an Outside Inn, a Sierra Gold, a Bilbo's, both inside and out.  The difference, the reason you should choose to eat here versus all those other close, fast & convenient options, is because Carlos is a dedicated chef and absolutely yearns to make you happy.  Without putting words into his mouth, he's crafted these dishes and prepares them for you because he wants people to eat better food, and there's more than one way to accomplish that goal besides being a 5-star Strip restaurant (which he could totally do if he wanted,). The easiest way for Carlos to reach the masses, or just to simply make one person's day better with a good meal, is to serve pub grub next to a video poker machine and do it better than anyone else in the neighborhood.\n\nThese types of restaurants used to be the norm, and they can be again if Vegas makes the concerted effort to drive past TGI Friday's and Red Lobster and support the guy who got up that morning intent on making their day better through nachos, burgers, and chocolate cake.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ba3-fDVhzLahunTUEMTsKg"}

I wouldn't drive across town for the calamari, but I would go for their drunken noodles every time I am in the area to get my hair done (once a month on average).

The unfortunate part is that the appetizers are only good if they are half off during happy-hour - I can't imagine paying full price for that.

Arepa itself was grilled and tasty.  \n\nColita soda - Venezuelan soda smelled and tasted like bubblegum - skip it.\n\nI want to go back to try Black beans & cheese $5 or Vegetarian $5.", "type": "review", "business_id": "blgSBn3CimrCHn2SuZvcZw"}

The smell of coffee filled my senses as I paced towards the cafe, carefully savoring every detail of Tivoli Village. You can't go wrong with its exquisite European touch and sophisticated vibe but I can't help but question the quality of their fruit smoothies.\n\n$3.75 (tax included) for a small fruit smoothie isn't bad. Plus, you can add up to 3 flavors (including mango, strawberry, blueberry, banana, pineapple etc.) with either orange juice, apple juice or regular as its base.  I opted for mango-banana with a milk base and despite it sounding really healthy, not to mention, being made at a really classy location, it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. There was just no wow factor to it. In fact, I believe I tasted way too much banana and almost no mango. My friend had a medium strawberry-banana smoothie and she didn't seem so enthusiastic about it as well. There's hope though because our other galpal couldn't stop raving about their yogurt (with fruits and granola). I don't exactly know how much it was and I tell ya, she had nothing but good things to say about it so you might want to try that out instead. \n\nNonetheless, the smoothie pulled down the rating a notch.

The dish comes with 3 tacos and we each had one but if I ate this by myself the sweeteness would be too much after 3 tacos. But with just the taste of one tacos it was fine.\n\nchicken was moist with a nice maple flavor, not too sweet. the pablano rice was bland, the aji amarillo sauce was nice, it's like a spicy mayo sauce with a kick. Overall, a B dish, not too delish... lol\n\nThe ribs were fall off the bones :) but they were too sweet!!! and frankly I wouldn't know there was root beer if you hadn't told me. It came with matchstick fries, which I found to be a little dry, but my friends liked it. The coleslaw was bland, it was barely creamy and it had dill. B plus, oh don't make me blush lol\n\nI also ordered the milkshake with nutella and torched marshmallows.

So far I've been disappointed by a lot of places I've tried in Pittsburgh. Given all the great reviews, I decided to try out M&P for brunch, keeping expectations low.\n\nWe didn't have reservations on Sunday, so we showed up exactly at 10:30am when the restaurant opens. 4 groups were already ahead of us waiting for seats at the bar. Tables were not available for walk-ins. The waiting area was dimly lit with ample seating which was great! Fortunately there were plenty of seats at the bar so we only waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Honestly, I think I prefer to sit at the bar - the bar table is quite spacious, there's a place to hang my bag, and there's much more excitement going on at the bar.\n\nThe food was really hit or miss. \n\nBrisket and egg (1/5): Super disappointed. This dish got such rave reviews on Yelp. I was expecting a Korean BBQ flavor but it was completely lacking in the brisket. The burnt edges were super dry and chewy. The brisket otherwise was so fatty both my bf and I had to spit out the fat. My bf liked the kimchi which was mixed with gochujang (I absolutely love gochujang!). It was extremely spicy so be sure you can handle it. The egg yolk was almost completely cooked and barely runny.\n\nGrilled bread (1/5): First, my bread was burnt and dry. Second, the raspberry jam was way too sweet. I've had the best fresh jam in NY (Beth's Farm Kitchen jam), and this jam at M&P tasted like Smucker's compared to that. \n\nFried taters (3/5): The fries were really good, however the seasoned fries at Winghart's are much, much better. Also it seemed like our fries were from the bottom of the bag, meaning they were all short instead of the long strings you see in the photos. These fries should've never been served.\n\nFrench toast (4/5): Now here's the saving grace. I am extremely picky about my french toast. I like it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside without being too eggy. I've had the best french toast of my life at ABC Kitchen and have tried it at a myriad of other restaurants in NYC. I've even been disappointed in some of the highly rated french toast dishes in NY. The french toast at M&P is absolutely delicious. It beats the banana french toast at Extra Virgin in the West Village, NY by a mile. I don't even like banana but it is delicious here. The portion is humongous. The sourdough is exquisitely caramelized on the outside and chewy on the inside (but not fluffy). The bacon almond brittle is a bonus, but I barely touched it because the french toast stands on its own. Definitely, definitely recommend this.\n\nRegarding drinks, my bellini was also ok, but my boyfriend's diet Coke was flat! \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back for the french toast and to try the chicken and waffles. I might even try dinner but not expect too much.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SsGNAc9U-aKPZccnaDtFkA"}

One taste of their cheese rolls and I was hooked. (btw, the closest thing I've come to Porto's cheese rolls in Las Vegas is Chef Flemming's cheese danishes. His store is in Henderson, you can check my profile for a review) \n\nIt's hard to compete with a giant like Porto's, especially to a self-professed Porto's fanatic, one that has eaten there no less than fifty times and half their menu. So, I was more than excited to try Roly's, a small unassuming bakery located in the Von's shopping center, that boasts that they are \"like\" Porto's. \n\nAnd for the most part, they live up to the boast. I've been there a handful of times over the years and I've thoroughly enjoyed my purchases. The cod croquettes are moist and flavorful, that have a nice crunchy exterior (think of gourmet fish sticks). Their potato balls are huge, filled with a spicy ground meat. It's both tasty and filling. \n\nThe star of the store is their pastries. I thought their mango and guava cakes were light and delicious. They appealed to my palate as they weren't overly sweet and the taste of the fruit outshined the cake. Also, there was no cream on the mango, just the mango filling and cake. Winner! \n\nI liked their guava streudel too. But c'mon, this was nothing like Porto's celebrated guava cheese roll, not even close. It had a tasty guava filling on typical strudel dough. \n\nThere's a lot of Cuban pastries and dishes on their menu. There are some I have never tried, such as their tocinillo de cielo, a pastry made with egg yolks, sugar and water and tastes much like flan (according to Wikipedia). \n\nOn their food menu, they have Cuban sandwiches, and omelettes. To round out the meal, they offer a different styles of coffee, the most interesting being the Cuban coffee, made from cuban espresso, a dark roast.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WQBp1GfsYOuOqqym8xq3RQ"}

I waited 25 minutes to receive my order. The party that ordered after me got their order about 7-10 minutes before me. The couple that ordered before me received their food in less than 15 mins. I had to ask where my order was. The cashier who took my order said she would have to check. It came about 5 minutes after my asking. I ask the person who delivered it, what the delay was. She said they were just really backed up. I asked why the party who ordered after me already had and well on their way to eating half their plates. She said she would need to check. She came back and said it was because they ordered sweet (vs. savory crepe). Not a great reason IMO. And no apology for my wait of 25 minutes for a crepe!, on a Tuesday morning, with only one party ordering in front of my order.

It was a decent choice, and for Casa Grande, very good.\n\nThe food was all very flavorful.  We had the Ropa Vieja and the Pechuga chicken.  Both dishes were seasoned well, and tasted good.  The beef was moist and the tomato wine sauce was rich and a great compliment to the beef.  The chicken was also moist and well seasoned.  While it tasted fine, I wish it came with maybe peppers on top to go with the chopped onions because it became a little monotonous to eat after a few bites.  The rice and beans on the side were nothing special.  Each dish came with two fried plantains, which were sweet and soft on the inside, and fried very well on the outside.\n\nThe service was ok, but weird.  The woman was friendly.  However, she messed up our order.  She insisted that she didn't.  Then, she insisted that what she brought to us in mistake was actually better than we wanted so we should keep it.  Then she went back to insisting that's what we ordered anyway.  The appetizer was more expensive than the one we wanted, there was no effort at all made to rectify the order mess up, and we were pretty much forced to eat what we didn't order (and pay for it).  But she was nice about it, annoyingly so.  I didn't want to argue at a birthday dinner, so I let it go, but she definitely lost some of her tip because of this.  She also tried to convince us into ordering dessert about three times, and she went on and on about it.  It was uncomfortable.  Otherwise, she was on top of the refills mostly.\n\nThe atmosphere is boring.  There's nothing in there that says \"Cuban\" to me besides the obnoxiously loud music playing.  The restaurant itself was very clean, including the bathrooms.\n\nI would go back to Feli's again, but probably for lunch to try the sandwiches.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nsLeo4ZopH-FRt4UqFKqyQ"}

The stage is set up in a pretty awesome way - behind all the beers. \n\nWith all the great things going for it, a few things felt off...for starters, the band playing was not the band listed on their website.  It wasn't even a bluesy band - just some rock cover band! I was wanting to kick back with some blues that evening, but instead got a cover of \"Your Sex is on Fire.\" \n\nAlso, what is up with the pea guacamole??! There is NO avocado in it (literally, its not just me being picky) - it is just mashed up peas with onions and garlic and lime.

But in practice, and I really hate to say it, a lot of things fell apart.\n\nSo I got a Groupon for this place when it first opened, and I was super excited about it.  Got a little nervous as I noticed more and more mediocre reviews, but we went in for dinner on Friday with an open mind.  Easy parking across the street, easy to get a table.  Our server strolled by to describe the drafts and give us the bottle list.  I got a draft of Michigan Pumpkin Spiced Ale, which I didn't like very much but that's my fault for not tasting it.  Strong spice flavors, like cinnamon and cloves, and there was a sugary rim around the glass which I didn't care for.  Oops!  I'll taste it next time.\n\nSo we drool over the menus before ordering an appetizer of Salt-Roasted Beets.  And let me say - I really need to rake them over the coals for this one.  This dish is described thusly: \"Chilled, creme fraiche, peppered greens, pickled grapefruit, chives, lemon oil.\"  In reality?  Someone roasted a beet.  Then it got cooled down and cut into random size wedges.  Someone put the wedges in some salty-watery liquid, then put them on a plate next to some arugula.  No.  No.  Nothing about this was $8.  The beets had this sort of filmyness on them from the liquid that was really unappetizing.  Nowhere did I get \"pickled grapefruit, chives, lemon oil.\"  or creme fraiche for that matter!  I mean, really.  This was ridiculous.  And I love beets!  It's hard to get me to NOT enjoy beets!  But somehow, they succeeded.\n\nSo we awaited our dinner, somewhat nervously.  So my boyfriend's \"A 'n' A\" burger arrives - that's a burger with blue cheese, caramelized onions, port glaze, and probably some other stuff.  We are told my food is coming shortly.  At LEAST five minutes go by, no sign of my food.  My boyfriend shares his fries with me until we finally decide to just start eating his burger.  When I took my bite, I took a look to see if it was properly cooked medium-rare.  What I saw on the inside was, frankly, uncooked meat.  I am sure of this.  I'm not being picky.  The texture was different - it was the texture of raw beef.  Like a patty that hadn't been thrown on the grill yet.  No.  We stopped a server to mention both that my food didn't yet exist, and that my boyfriend's food was basically not finished cooking.  \n\nThe server took it back, and a few minutes later came back to apologize, saying both she and the chef totally agreed that this burger was not currently in a state of being edible.  She said, \"can I get you a drink on the house?  Or a shot?\"  We said yes, and as she went off to get the shots I thought to myself that I'd rather have been offered, you know, a free burger.  Or something.  We still had beers to drink and hadn't really planned on taking shots.  In retrospect, I think it'd be better service to take something we had already purchased OFF the bill instead of giving us a free something we weren't going to get anyway.  But we didn't really feel in a position to negotiate when she suggested shots, so we accepted.  My boyfriend got lured in by the word \"Jameson,\" turns out the shot was something like Jameson + butterscotch schnapps, tasting much more strongly of schnapps than Jameson, with an orange juice chaser.  Kind of weird, but okay.\n\nSo a little while later, my boyfriend's burger appears and I am told that my Shepherd's pie is still cooking and will be out soon.  What in the hell?  Seriously, 5 minutes later, my food appears.  Why is that happening?  There are only two of us!  I understand when you have large parties, the meals get staggered.  But you can't time a burger and a shepherd's pie to be done at the same time?  Seriously, it kind of sucks.  I was starting to believe my shepherd's pie didn't really exist, and then it arrived, bubbling super hot from the oven. My boyfriend's burger was properly cooked this time, so he got to eat it - and quite liked it, I think - and I got to eat my pie.  I liked my food too - it was pretty simple and traditional, but rich with meaty gravy and yummy potatoes.  If the food had been brought out this way to begin with (and those salt-roasted beets didn't exist), this could've been a 4-star review.  But alas.\n\nWe finished our food, I needed to take some of mine to go since it was humungous, and then we got our check.  Now, our server told us later that he was training so I forgive him this, but he put down that I got an $11 beer on the bill (when really it was $5), which I'm really glad we noticed and brought to his attention.  Not down with accidentally paying twice as much!  When we left, we pretty much agreed - the servers did their best to make up for our experience, but we're pretty much scared away from Alchemy 'n' Ale.  I really wanted to love it, but sadly I didn't even come close.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HjrK4QKp9MZbeopSbc6Evw"}

The salad dressing was great on the Beef and Potatoes and Pita!\n\nThe Potatoes Harra had a very nice flavor!  The Pita was A-OK.  I prefer this one over the thin version many places serve!  The Red Lentil Soup was very good without lemon and even better with lemon!\n\nBaklava (made the right way - they said it and I did too) this is the \"drier\" version with Pistachios and not laden in Syrup or honey.  The other dessert with the shredded filo and thicker richer walnut filling was good too!  \n\nTurkish Coffee is one of my favorite drinks and I love that almost anywhere I get it is \"presented\" in a way that I have no words for right now!  This Turkish Coffee was very good and look at my photos and you'll see what I mean!\n\nThe Music was INCREDIBLE and most of it was Dance!  Little English on English lyrics.  My thought is I would rather be exposed to something different because I may like it and want to find out more, potentially being introduced to even more that I like!  If I were rating the music I would give it 5 yelp stars.\n\nThe Service was very fast (faster than a speeding ticket) I could tell they were prepared to take care of those wanting to hurry back to work (I know I did not say it the way you mean it).  All three of the staff that helped me today were very friendly, knowledgeable and proud of their food and music!\n\nSome of my photos did not turn out so I guess to be fair I'll have to go back.  If you see my photos in one the place looks empty and almost was at 2:00pm today, though at 1:15 it was mostly full!  If you ask me if this place was a Lookalota I'd might say and then some.  Some of the patrons were on the shy side.  In case any of the customers got a clue (they watched me take photos) I appreciate it very much!\n\nSunday April 8th 2012 (also known as EASTER Sunday)  Turkish Breakfast!\n\nI said TURKISH Breakfast - Breakfast is the \"breaking\" of a Fast (period of foodlessness) not the making of a fast break!  This is a take your time multiple dishes a great break from the hurry up that you can have a rest from while eating!\n\nPlease ask: What did it look like?  I TOOK PHOTO'S! !! !!!  What did it sound like? \"Breakfast on Turkish\"!  What was it?  \n\nPlate 1. Cheese (Feta and Provolone), Cucumbers, Tomatoes, green Olives and Katamala Olives - Condiments: Honey, Jam (of some kind) Olive Oil (with Spices) and Fantastic Mixture of Tahini and Grape Molasses.  Side plate of bread (two slices).\n\nPlate 2. Simit (Savory Pastry) I think they had three to choose from.  The one I chose was filled with a minced Olive filling and had a baked on egg yoke topping with Poppy seeds (looked like a Chocolate covered and Chocolate filled Eclair - tasted better, I'm not the Eclair fan you thought I was).\n\nPlate 3. Turkish Sausage and Egg Omelet!  I put the Tahini and Grape Molasses on this and everything and it was something special!\n\nGlass Mug of Turkish Tea (Hot) this is the good one and was very good even before I put ONE pack of Sugar in it!\n\nDessert!  BOY do you have to EAT Dessert with every meal?  I do not!  When I get a chance I may take a chance!  This was like a Cookie with a Macadamia Nut in the middle.  The \"cookie\" was soft with a hint of??? Maybe lemon?\n\nTurkish Breakfast: Saturdays and Sundays (call for hours) Yesterday it was 10:00am til Noon!", "type": "review", "business_id": "QlXxMRAznnbgzdT2yk5r2w"}

The person on the phone is also really nice too and is pretty darn helpful when it comes to figuring out what you want (especially if you can't see the menu).\n\nI've had the egg rolls here and they are pretty good. Sometimes they are cooked a bit too much but it doesn't detract from the taste. The crab puffs are also pretty good but I wish they had more filling in them. The potstickers are fantastic! They aren't super squishy or super crunchy, they are a perfect mix of both with the bottom being more crunchy then the top. The filling is great and doesn't look questionable. I wish the dipping sauce for them was a bit more tart but I still like it. The sweet and sour sauce is pretty good.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that if your order the Orange chicken (or any similar kind of dish) it is swimming in sauce. I'd prefer less sauce so the breading doesn't fall off so easy. However the chicken is good quality and so is the breading.\n\nAll in all this is a good place but because of the sauce thing I'm going to stick with fried food. \n\nTheir delivery is reasonable with a 10$ minimum and a 1$ delivery fee.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xr0SQ1i6vHgT0RBZfyzJ8Q"}

This is a small restaurant with seats for around 30 people inside and maybe 15-20 outside. Combined with plain wooden tables and fun cutlery, makes this an intimate experience. The middle of the room has what appears to be a homemade chandelier made from glass jars. One wall has a large vertical fern garden (with real ferns!). It was well put together without overstating itself. I love it! Jack Johnson was playing in the background, which added to the relaxed theme.\n \n\nThe Service: Wow! These were some of the most attentive and knowledge staff I have experienced. I never wanted for water (which came with a hint of cucumber). The sourcing of menu specials were described (cheese from the Goat Lady). The server that we had was pleasantly talkative and I could see great opportunities for small talk, if that is your thing. Very courteous and friendly!\n\n\nThe Food: \n\n- Bruschetta (deserving of 3 paragraphs): I am not a bruschetta guy; however, this was hands down the most delicious appetizer I have ever had. This appetizer lived up to the name and actually stimulated my appetite. In fact, we both were left craving more throughout the dinner to the point of seriously considering getting one more order for dessert (it's not sweet, just THAT good)! \n\nThis aint no red paste/salsa looking glob on a bread. No, it was asparagus, tomato, lion's mane mushroom (and some more veggie yumminess that eludes me at the moment) perfectly seasoned on a crispy, garlicky, buttery slice of bread.\n\nThe only possible downside is that the restaurant changes its bruschetta daily (or maybe weekly), so future experiences may differ. However, I fully place my bruschetta trust in the chief to deliver and WILL be ordering the bruschetta in the future.\n\n\n- Arugula salad: This came with arugula, walnuts, pumpkin, and pumpkin seeds with a pomegranate dressing. The portioning of the salad seemed in-between a side salad and dinner salad. Definitely get a side or appetizer (bruschetta mayhaps...) if you are hungry. \n\nWhereas certainly not bad, we both found the pomegranate dressing to be a bit too intense and sweet--overpowering the other flavors. \n\n\n- CM Burger: solid veggie patty with toasted wheat bun. The patty was particularly enjoyable because it was not trying to be like a hamburger in texture or taste. This resulted in a crispy on the outside patty of veggie awesome. The toppings were fantastic. Only drawback was that the patty tends to fall apart easily, but this minor inconvenience is well worth the effort. Would get again!\n\n- Side of Veggies: the burger came with a choice of sides. I choose the veggies, which contained squash, zucchini, carrot, onion, and green beans. These were sauteed perfectly, not soggy like defrosted mixed veggies. The green beans could have been cooked a bit longer, but a minor issue. Deliciousness comes at a price though--butter. And lots of it. Veggies can only taste this sinfully good with a large amount of butter. It didn't bug me at all, but it may be a concern to others.\n\n\nOverall: Coming back again. Soon. Even though not a vegetarian, I really appreciate well-prepared vegetarian food. There is a lot of variety  and unique flavors at Fern and I am not done exploring yet.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VsaFeXDhG75yTWUGTDzNAA"}

I did indeed tell the manager when he made his \"all ok\" rounds that they needed to improve their pour or lower the price. most pathtic pour I have seen in a long time & I just got back from CA. Nuff said. The food? Pretty dismal. I can eat a good pretzel 'til the cows come home. Alas, this was not a good pretzel. It tasted like a frozen Super Pretzel that had been put in the oven; dry, tasteless, cardboardish. My friend's \"flat bread\" was also dry, stale and had stingy ingredients. We could barely detect the cheese and the prosciutto tasted and looked like thinly shaved ham. The portion of toppings was almost non-existent--didn't even cover the length of the obviously store bought flat \"bread\". (I've had tastier communion wafers).  The salad came with two tips of asparagus. There was also supposed to be some candied pecans and crumbled ch\u00e8vre & grapefruit with a citrus dressing. There were perhaps a few pinhead sprinkles of ch\u00e8vre, lots o' lettuce and some small broken pieces of pecan at the bottom of the plate that were unfortunately burned. The taste of the burned nuts with the bitter/sour dressing that seemed to be flavored with merely oil and lemon juice did not make for a tasteful combination. The kid didn't eat the soup. Fortunately I was able to dip a few pieces of the \"homemade\" pretzel into this to assist with swallowing.  I had to eat something after getting drunk on that 5 oz's of wine, for safety's sake. I could have gotten loopy.  Unfortunately I received a text later from my friend after having parted, only to learn that she had already made multiple trips to the bathroom after her \"lunch.\"  To make matters worse, they were playing bad boy band trendy videos the whole time we were there. $53 bucks for some crappy, half considered food, an empty joint, and really bad, loud pop factory videos makes for a never again. Perhaps they have good burgers, who knows, but charging $8.95 for a dried out pretzel is pretty criminal in my book--so if those burgers or corned beef sandwiches are good, I shall never know. I won't be back; too many other choices in this big town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Nq7eB1wB2EArUICtiNePvQ"}

Read All About It!\n\nYou're a wise man or woman, if you read some of the reviews of Greens and Proteins before trying them out.  You'll find a mix of \"I've experienced better\", \"A-Ok\", and \"As good as it gets\".  The most common issue...the sticker shock.  Yup, Greens and Proteins is on the Richie Rich side for what you get in quantity.  Smoothies over $10 (not lying), sandwiches over $12 (no five-dollar foot long here), and even their burgers are pricey starting around $10 (Where's the beef?).  I read the reviews and was armed with knowledge before I step foot in here. So, why the 5 Stars from me?   It comes to down to what I think Greens and Proteins was trying to accomplish, eating on the healthier side.  One thing about eating healthier, it sure cost more and I knew that coming in.  5 Stars because I expected less and got more.  \n\nI came here for their Proteins, not the Greens, and decided on the \"Build Your Own Custom Meal\".  This is a 4 Step process, but I only chose Step 1, which was protein only.   You have a choice of Filet Mignon ($17), Bison ($13), Chicken ($10), Turkey ($9), Salmon ($13), and even my favorite lean meat Ostrich ($17).  I got the salmon and they knocked a few bucks off the price because I didn't get anything else with it.  The salmon is about 6 oz and to be honest, it was a little bland.  I solved this by adding a little Teriyaki sauce to it.  Voila! Problem solved. \n\nAs for the restaurant and ambiance, it's just okay.  You get a mix of your Average Joes, Fitness Freaks, and New Year Resolutioners.  My favorite is the guy wearing a tank top, beanie, and sunglasses.  Guess this guy is just confused whether it's hot ,cold, or sunny inside.  Or, he's just too cool for the rest of us.  The wait is little longer than expected and since the restaurant is also small, it gets a little loud and crowded.\n\nOverall, I am a fan and think Greens and Protein is as good as it gets.  If you're looking for something quick, cheap, and tasty, then Greens and Proteins may not be for you.  If you're looking for something clean, healthier, and don't mind spending a little more, then Greens and Proteins is perfect.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EQxbEKkHxNvRT_-S5A-Gcw"}

It has a certain charm to it being tucked in under a hill of the Black Mountain. The building looks very new and the interior is smaller, but modern and clean. When I arrived late afternoon on a Thursday there were only couple of other patrons there. The female bartender was very friendly and accommodating. She told me about their $2 Dos Equis special. I usually do a shot of whiskey and a beer if I am not in the mood for a cocktail. They didn't have Jim Beam's Devil's Cut so I settled on Jack Daniel's Honey. I also told her about the Yelp check in special that is good for one free domestic pint or a well drink. She was very excited that someone has finally claimed it. I opted for a whiskey sour and another beer. I asked her if she could change one of the TV channels to a news channel and she happily obliged. If she stayed, this review would have easily been four stars, but it was the end of her shift. A male and female bartender took over. Their focus became on the silver hairs that kept on trickling in -- the regulars I guess. I asked to look at the food menu, and everything was pretty pricey for bar food. The cheapest burger was ~$10... no thanks. I finished my drink and called it a day. The total was only $10.50 because they had good specials and my free check in drink. One star for the location since it is walking distance to the house and one star for the initial bartender.

This is simply a question of food quality and preparation.  I won't even go into the far departure from authentic in this review.\n\nThe chips and salsa were inedible.  The chips were stale and oversalted.  The \"salsa\" tasted like the tomato and chile mixture you get in a can and was too watery to be scooped by a chip.  This was the worst I have been served anywhere.\n\nI ordered a grilled chicken burrito.  The flour tortilla was pretty nice.  The filling was mostly chicken and it didn't taste grilled.  Grilled to me is over a flame.  That aside, it was to come with guacamole and there wasn't any in there at all.  I was expecting rice and beans but none there either.  There was a scant amount of pico, lettuce and tomato.  I tried dousing it with the tomatillo salsa but it didn't do much and the other 2 salsas offered were just ground up chiles which I found to be ridiculous.  The lack of effort and interest here was astounding.  There was a lake of some sort of liquid at the bottom of my basket when I was finished.  Was this from the pico?  I can't even believe I had to eat here.\n\nI tried some of my wife's mole and was really super glad I didn't order that dish.  The 2 enchiladas were supposed to come with rice and beans.  She didn't get them so went up to buy a portion of beans.  They looked and tasted as if they had come out of a can.\n\nI ordered a chicken taco after because I was still hungry and desperate to find an edible menu item.  The counter person asked me if I wanted everything.  This included lettuce, tomato, cheese, pico, guac or sour cream.  None of these things should be put on a chicken taco.  I asked her why they didn't come with cilantro and onions as they should and she said that the locals would rather have the other ingredients and offered to send it out as I pleased.  This was nice but telling.  The taco would have been average but the tortillas were terrible and oil soaked and again the same grilled chicken was uninspired at best.  \n\nGo try Vicky's Mexican Restauant, come back here and tell me you're still a fan or that you think it's as good as it gets.

Obviously, since I have gone that often, I like it. With some experimentation, I Really like it. It is certainly the best option in LV for NY style. \n\nFirst - the crust is very good, but is Much better when you order a small rather than a large, and when you eat in. In particular, the bottom of the crust is a bit dense when you get it to go (obviously - pizza has a short life span), but it is also a little hard when I ordered a large to eat in - I think that this is because it is cooked longer. So I ordered a small, and the crust is near perfect on a small - great charring and very airy. Good Bread. I also like the olive oil the crusts are basted in - DM's puts a Lot of olive oil on top, and it spreads to the crust, and I like that. \n\nSecond - The cheese - I like the mix - I have never had one as tangy, and I prefer this to the fresh mozz on Neapolitan style. But there is a bit too much of it. I've added two pictures where I think that you can see it is a bit soupy on a large. This is also better on a small - I also asked for light cheese the last two times I was there and it was very good. \n\nThe minimalist sauce is very good, and the toppings are excellent - I mentioned that I liked the pepperoni, because it was thick enough to stand up under crisping. The sausage pie is also very good - it was very spicy with rough chunks. I like the basil - I asked if I could get the basil on it before it was cooked, which I prefer - but I was told that that wasn't okay, which I understand - that is ideological, and definitely their call. \n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nGood, but not great. \n\nHave anticipated the opening for a while. It is definitely  a transplant rather than the original - it tasted like a mass produced copy of great pizza, which still puts it Way ahead of pizza in Las Vegas, but will disappoint New Yorkers. \n\nVery good sauce and toppings - the sauce is very simple tomatoes and herbs, rather than a cooked sauce, so it tasted very fresh and tangy, rather than too sweet. The pepperoni was very good - thick enough and crispy to give a snap when biting into it. \n\nThe crust is tasty, but the texture was not perfect. This is my fault - I got it Carry Out, and had to drive for 15 minutes, so it tasted more floury and a bit dense as it cooled off. I intend to try it again in the restaurant.\n\nI also thought that there was too much cheese. \n\nWeird note - the boxes were a pain - they did not stay folded into a box, and the end kept coming open, and I almost lost the whole cheese pie as it almost slid out the end - I don't know if the boxes were cheap or just bad, but it was a pain.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2f7TvlG5zcuMCHcQjxqS6A"}

Secondly, when anyone tells me a place has the best anything...I am extra critical because that's a very lofty claim to make.\n\nSo...our group was seated on the patio, which I thought was pretty cool. We weren't a huge group, but they still gave up the whole patio to ourselves. They have a huge fireplace out there which obviously wasn't lit because it's summer, but I imagine it would be really pretty in the winter months.\n\nOur service was great. All of our drinks were refilled without us having to ask. Everything was brought to us with a smile and in a very timely manner.\n\nSo...was it the best pizza in Vegas?!?!\n\nI would have to say...YES. Awesome crust. Fresh toppings that were well balanced. Great service.\n\nAmongst the group we ordered 4 different pizzas to try...\n\n1) The Bianca which is a white pizza with ricotta, garlic, basil...and it was just OUSTANDING. I could easily eat it everyday!! And, we got it on a thick crust which was phenominal.\n\n2) The Margherita which was very basil-y...so I LOVED it. I would, also, go back just for this pizza.\n\n3) The Big Apple which is sort of their answer to a meat lovers...ham, pepperoni, sausage, and I think meatball. I didn't really eat this one, but I did try a piece of the pepperoni itself which was great & there was none left over of this one so it was obviously good.\n\n4) The White Truffle. This one had truffle oil, mushrooms, garlic...I am not a mushroom or a truffle oil fan so I skipped this one.\n\nI, also, got a cannoli to go. And, it was fantastic.\n\nThis place will probably be our new pizza place...and I will probably start telling people it is the best pizza in Vegas.\n\nYou should definitely check them out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2f7TvlG5zcuMCHcQjxqS6A"}

(See my photo taken at DiFara's in Brooklyn.)\n\nFirst the differences. The crust was not as thin as DiFara's in Brooklyn and the oil was not present as it is in Brooklyn. In Brooklyn the pan has a pool, not a coat, of oil under the pizza, after it is eaten. Not much oil was present here and that was just from the cheese, not from the generous amount of oil that is poured on pizzas made by Dominic himself.\n\nThe good news is that the pizza tastes the same, which is fantastic. There is no better. \nThere are some advantages to the LV pizzeria. \n\nComfortable chairs/tables and some elbow room. Working restrooms open to the public.\nTV. A full bar, free refills on soft drinks which are from a fountain. No hour long lines to get a table and fill an order. Tables are clean here, unlike in Brooklyn where they depend on people cleaning their own tables. \n\nThere is a full menu for Italian food, other than the fantastic pizza. We had a waiter, which does not exist in Brooklyn. \n\nThere is even a parking lot. How about that! Also this restaurant is open all day including Monday and Tuesday. Sorry, no private parties on Thursday night yet. \n\nPizza is not $28. for no toppings. It is listed at $18. but they gave us half off because of some promotion. Wow! $9.00 for an authentic DiFara's pizza!\n\nGiven a choice, I would prefer the excessively oiled pizza with the thinner crust in Brooklyn.

I've seen my fair share of nightclubs from the inception of the scene with Studio 54, Rum Jungle, Utopia, to the transformation into the mega club!! The over the top gaudy large scale party behemoth the Las Vegas party scene has become today.  \n\nIf you want a good time come to Hyde for an awesome club, small and lots of character.  From the amazing view of the Bellagio fountains, to the hype men dressed in horse head costumes, crazy gogo dancers dressed in awesome get ups .... and one of the last clubs in Vegas with HIp Hop/Mix/Top 40 music. \n\nAlmost every time I come here I have a good time.\n\nParking: Bellagio self parking, stay right, but don't walk outside in the lobby and you'll hit Hyde.  Not too far of a walk.. not like Hakkasan at MGM.\n\nEntry:  Look up and call ahead to see if the club has a guestlist.  This is good for mostly free or discounted entry for girls, but some clubs let guys in free with a 1:1 guy: girl ratio.  Doesn't hurt asking. \n\nTable line: Facing Hyde located at the left.  The podium is there, and the front is small so if you booked a table you can find your host there, or if you're walking up get in the table reservation line.  Tables are LIMITED here so be sure to arrive early, before 1130 or all the tables get sat.\n\nBars: 1 main bar as you walk in all the way the right.... and another small bar in the far adjacent corner when you walk in.\n\nHyde is not well known because it is smaller but I honestly love this club. Although if you're on the patio tables sometimes the spray of the fountain mist wets you a little bit.  For girls, that can be a big no no. \n\nEXIT:  When exiting folks, don't go out where ya came in, go behind the DJ booth as you were going the bathroom which brings me to my next point... bathroom is outside the club... right outside... don't you worry now.. it's not too far. About 10 meters from exit.\n\nGo Sundays for XIV for a crazy day party during the colder days.  Day parties = to help ease the withdrawal of non-pool party season.\n\nFor an independent host with no fees and no rip offs guaranteed... give me a shout jennysvegas.com or 7025055014 for table inquiries.", "type": "review", "business_id": "glmwOs55H49Q_D8ENZtqYQ"}

These ribs are no joke the bomb diggity! They are so tender, the meat literally almost melts in your mouth and it is coated in a sweet flavorful marinade.  It's BBQ meat but tastes like it could be braised...what kind of Korean magic trick is this =P I don't think any of the other Korean BBQ establishments serve the short ribs thick cut, all the other places generally have the thinner cut ones similar to the ones at Hawaiian restaurants.  Also they have all the other items like rib eye, marinated beef, pork belly, spicy pork, beef belly, squid, steamed egg, etc.  The only item that is not on the list, that places like Sura have, is shrimp.  This is not one of those establishments where you go and pick your meat, instead you order off a menu and they come to your table and cook the meat for you.  For the price of $25 for AYCE, it's on par with the other restaurants, but the galbi is what will have me coming back here instead of other places.  The banchan is a little limited, only three or four items....and I noticed because I always notice Asian biases...other tables with Korean speaking customers received \"extra\" banchan and maybe a little extra attention while they were there.  But overall, the customer service is still better than some of the other AYCE Korean places, since they did come and flip the meat and cut the pork belly and kalbi into smaller pieces for us.  They also serve an after dinner drink....a sweet cinnamon/ginger/dried persimmon punch with pine nuts...meant to aid in the digestion of the copious amounts of meat inhaled.  This place is owned by Mr. Lee of Lee's liquors....as was made obvious as he sat and enjoyed his dinner and a glass of wine in the corner....Mr. Lee is clearly a very successful businessman...and now he has another money making sensation on his hands.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Qs_rxSL6BfBFzAr30VLeuw"}

Everything was hot and fresh. My husband said his single burger with cheese was good and he would definately order the double next time. My onion rings had great flavor but some were crispy and others not so much. My child ate all of his single slider so I would say it's a thumbs up there.\n4. The food came out quickly.\n\nThe Cons.\n1. We found it a little on the pricey side. The single steakburger was $3.09 plus the $.50 for cheese. \n2. I was kinda of irritated that after paying $2.49 for a small basket of onion rings I had to pay another $.50 if I wanted ranch to dip them in. They only come with ketchup.\n3.They charge $.50 if you want a refill on your drinks. Drink station is behind the counter.\n4. Restrooms are outside. (that is no fault of theirs though so no stars deducted.)\n5. No combo meals. If my husband wanted fries with his burger it would have been another $1.89. With the addition of a drink (medium $1.79) it would have made $7.17 for a single combo without tax.\n\nWe liked Shorty's and will more than likely make another go of it. On a Saturday about 11:30 they had a steady stream of mostly to go orders. Drive thru is a great convenience too. We hope Shorty's survives in this economy, a great local run business, but they might want to change a few things to make it a little more economical.", "type": "review", "business_id": "I4pSBXlKdR6assqRdVjtMg"}

The soft boiled egg was indeed soft boiled which is good, but it was was still cold and not heated up yet from the soup so that could be improved.\n\nOverall I would definitely come to try this place again when I am capable of finishing an entire bowl.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kgt13cwkP03NS8FJKgdLMw"}

I am Cuban and went to Peruvian Restaurants back home in Northern New Jersey. I have eaten Peruvian in Toronto, Madrid and even Paris. It's a wonderful cuisine from a fabulous culture- and I love that !\n\nBy brother  came back from this restaurant with rave reviews. So I had to know it was good- and it was ! The place is not perfect- but the food was. After reading the reviews here I expected high prices and small portions. Well, I am as big as house @360lbs and I hate small portions. These were not small portions. I actually took food home with me. \n\nThe appetizers,  delicious- the stuffed mashed potato with a layer of chicken salad a topped with a light cream sauce. Not just delicious, it was beautifully prepared. Although I was not expecting a cold dish, as soon as I stuffed some in my mouth, I just shut up and ate. The appetizer of boiled potato with a cream sauce ( reminds me of a Hollandaise sauce) was excellent. What, no tamales ?  :(\n\nEntrees- the Lomo al Caballo  ($11.25- and totally worth it) - wonderfully seasoned chicken breast sauteed with french fries, tomatoes and sweet onions and all brilliantly topped with two sunny side eggs and a side of white rice and fried sweet bananas- the best bananas I ever ate ( and I'm Cuban). Growing up my favorite Cuban dish- and probably still is - the ultimate Cuban comfort food: Fried eggs over white rice and french fries!  Is was my favorite thing there. My partner and I fought for it. \n\nSecond entree- Tallarin Salteados, ($ 9.95) Think lo mein without the distractions of bean sprouts and other veggies- just loin steak ( which was like butter), sweet onions, and tomatoes in a wonderful sauce. It was actually better when I ate it at midnight. \n\nFinally desert was Peruvian Fried donuts- like a light funnel cake. Thank God we each ordered a serving as they were excellent, although I did not care for the syrup that they were sitting on- they didn't need it.\n\nThis is Fine Dining people. The prices are not high considering the size and quality of the food. Taste is subjective but I can't for the life of me understand why this was so harshly reviewed by the one gentleman. Soap suds in the soda ? Please ! Look I'm not Peruvian- I'm not Italian, but damn know good food.  As for not having enough choice on the menu, it's a smart chef that controls quality by not offering everything. Except for the tamale- all the usual suspects are here.\n\nThe place was clean. Service could have been better- not that we did not get our food quickly, but because the help was sitting around talking- no biggie- but annoying. The chef cooks everything fresh and at the moment, so it's not fast food.\n\nAnd as for the man with the one star review, I can only think that he ( or his wife-god bless her little heart) ,might have an agenda. Dare I say, maybe she is friends with the competition ?", "type": "review", "business_id": "6E_-uIvgD-ROtcZNyFEj6A"}

I was conned by people claiming this place was a Mecca for AYCE sushi.  I don't think it's bad, but it's not great.  And from someone who isn't a sushi snob at all, that's pretty crap-tastic.  My wife didn't like the sushi at all.  I think we're going to have to stick to Yama Sushi, Island Sushi, or Sushi Fever.  I had the SSS roll (shrimp lover type roll), some salmon and yellowtail nigiri, the octopus roll, and a couple other rolls.  The SSS roll had a strange texture, but it was alright.  You can't go wrong with nigiri.  It was fresh and delicious.  The octopus roll had lemon rind in it.  Really?  It kills all other flavors.  It really wasn't good...\n\nAnother thing I noticed was that they put the chipotle mayo and yum yum sauce on our rolls, even though those sauces weren't in descriptions.  Normally people probably don't care, but I'm not a big fan of either.  I prefer ponzu or nothing at all.  Also, the cream cheese tasted a bit off.  We didn't get sick at all, so it wasn't spoiled, but it just didn't have a good taste to it.\n\nSorry Sushi Freak.

It's a standard hamburger with the usual condiments but where it takes on a life of its own is the generous addition of ham. Not quite a cold cut, not quite a carver's select, but something in between. The whole thing is sandwiched between a bun (top AND bottom) that has been sliced and stuffed with with cheese. For a dollar more, you can order a half order of the self-proclaimed \"Best\" fries which is a sufficient helping of freshly sliced potato, fried and salted. Tasty, but being stuck in a Styrofoam to go box left them limp. I also got a Bean & Cheese burrito because they do claim to be a Latin American restaurant.

This place was thoroughly satisfying. The food was phenomenal, along with the service. Perfect for a casual dinner with indulgent barbecue meat and a hearty beer. The only reason I knocked a star off was because of the location (a bit off the beaten path of Shadyside) and limited selection of beers on tap, granted the few they had were good. \n\nAmbience:\nThe owners definitely chose the right decor to set the unassuming barbecue mood. Plenty of high tables with no frills- just slats of rather unfinished wood. Kind of what I would hope for from an authentic barbecue spot. On the other hand, the location really seems to kill the business here. Being a bit off of Shadyside proper and given the seedy neighborhood, it seems that people are deterred from visiting, which (at least on a Wednesday evening) resulted in an oddly quiet and empty restaurant. At least we didn't have to wait for seating!\n\nFood:\nWow. We went for happy hour which included half off for wings, which made it quite reasonably priced. I had the habanero wings and my buddy had the BBQ ones. I preferred the habanero ones- just enough kick and well seasoned. I could of used a more generous slather of the sauce but the selling point was really in the meat. The wings were grilled and smoked. The slow cooking process really locked in the juices to make the meat fall apart. And these weren't mini sized wings... We also had the brisket and, not to be repetitive, but...wow. Moist, falls apart in your mouth and flavorful. All in all, I was rather content with the food. \n\nDrinks:\nI can't comment on the cocktails but the liquor selection was reasonable. The beers on draft were limited but interesting enough. Definitely was hoping for more beers on tap given this is a barbecue joint.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oJwy0ELke7wS6WsztypYwQ"}

This place is amazing!! \n\nIt was a huge deal for me and my friends to come to Steak ready to splurge, especially since we're just a bunch of ordinary college students with a simple love of good food. But boy, was the price worth it. We were started off with a bread appetizer, which was superb! We especially enjoyed the two different types of brioche as well as the little sample of butter topped with a type of salt (I forget what type). We were even offered another round of bread and after a split second of \"We don't want to fill up before our meal\", we looked at each other with grins on our faces and agreed that we should never turn down free bread. \n\nMy friends ordered the Beef Wellington and I ordered the Ribeye for one along with the haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, and asparagus sides. The beef wellington was TO DIE FOR; it was extremely tender and flavorful, and the pastry on the outside was flaky and complimented the meat perfectly. Now I know why it is Ramsay's specialty (also note that it is cooked medium-rare). My ribeye was delicious as well as HUGE. It was cooked beautifully and didn't even need any sauces or extra seasoning. My favorite side had to be the haricot verts as I LOVE tempura and I don't know what they put in the batter...but it was better than any tempura batter I've ever had in my life. The three of us struggled immensely to finish our plates (and we didn't), but knew that we had to fit as much of the delicious food into our stomachs as humanly possible. \n\nWe then decided to end with the three of us sharing the sticky toffee pudding, which was out of this world. I just remember stifling a laugh when the waiter asked us how our dessert was and my friend's eyes just rolled to the back of her head. He definitely got a good chuckle out of that. \n\nThe service was better than I could've ever imagined. Every 2 minutes or so our waiter would walk by and make sure that our water glasses were filled and that all of our needs were met. One of the waiters even escorted my friend to the bathroom when she asked where it was! Whaaat? They were also probably the sweetest wait staff that I had ever had the pleasure of encountering and I honestly just wanted to give them all a hug as we left. \n\nAfter about 2 hours and $300 later, we all left more than satisfied, and ready to take on the town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mDdqifuTrfXAOfxiLMGu5Q"}

Greeted by an army of hostesses and one walks you to your table.  Now this is when the restaurant fails.  A waiter turns from another table and taps on our table and says \"I will be right there.\"   So we sat for 15 minutes with no menu, no beverages, and a fully staffed restaurant and were basically ignored.  I couldn't take it anymore so I had to get a different waiter from the other tables to help us.  The guy was great and very knowledgeable.  30 minutes later our original waiter comes by during our appetizers and did the meat cut showing.  He says it's part of the experience of being there.  So I guess the experience is ignore your customers, show me raw meat during my eating and show me cuts of meats after I have already ordered.  Then came the biggest disappointment of the night, my rib eye boned in piece of leather.  The meat was so tough, you have to saw into it just to eat.  I never sawed into a medium rare steak ever in my life.  I asked for a sharper knife but they only carried cerrated butter knives at this steak house.  I do recommend the coffee, it was excellent.  Dinner for two $350 bill for good coffee.  By the way, the beef Wellington, the crust is supposed to be flaky not soggy.  Will not recommend or return to this place.

Um, hold up here... something's fishy.\n\nSo I ask the server if that's for real. She said, yes, it's a 20 minutes wait. But here's the thing. The bar was packed in the back, but the tables... I'm going to guess they were probably 1/3 full with guests, the rest were completely empty.

I think I have been to almost every eatery in this shopping plaza give or take but Bachi Burger was my elusive Triple Crown that kept escaping me....California Chrome I feel your pain. \n\nFor a few years I heard that the burgers here were great and it's true. I have been on a personal search for the best burger in LV and Bachi Burger is a bonafide contender.\n\nThis is simply a great burger! I chose the Kikis burger and it was smooth as a Ferrari Modena gliding up the PCH... headed for the Strawberry Festival of course. 805 stand up!  I don't know if any other burger has Bachi  Burger's flavor.  It's definitely not a big burger by any means. I could knock down three of them and be looking for number four!  However, size is not a factor here because quality wins you over. First off, the bun is of a superior quality,  baked fresh and brought in daily from an outside bakery.  It shows. The bun is shiny and moist which helps to make the whole burger pop. I usually need something to wash a burger down, but with the Kikis I could've dry dropped it- I mean I could've... but I didn't. I recommend ordering the burger medium well because it comes out perfect. Just enough pink so flavor is not lost with a well done burger. They give you a tasty Aioli sauce on the side but you won't even need it. The burger speaks for itself. The burger is presented very well also. Ordered the garlic fries and was not disappointed. Excellent! They come sprinkled with a good portion of jalape\u00f1os on top and are very tasty and they are enough to share.\n\nService was good. The rap on Bachi Burger has been the long wait times to get your food, however I didn't find that to be the case in our experience and this is serving four adults and two small kids. The kid's grilled cheese looked awesome by the way, garnished with an apple slice with a few carrots. Parking is not an issue here either- you could park a tractor trailer in this lot if you needed to. I hope you don't need to. For this quality of burger the price was not bad. The Kiki's comes in at about 12 bucks. For desert, go next door to Rocket Fizz and go hog wild reliving your childhood with some retro candies and sodas. So the bottom line is that my search for the best burger in Vegas has yielded a top ranked contender here...who else can step in the ring with Bachi Burger?", "type": "review", "business_id": "t6SuvEq9PPVGzNv5bJzDtw"}

She always wants Asian food (doesn't dent my hunger in an affordable manner usually) and didn't want Mexican (a staple in my diet). Remembering there was a burger place inside Wildfire Casino, I figured we could stop by there, as I heard good things. We make it to the 42+\" TV Screen menu and figure out what we want. Before we were fully decided, the cashier girl came over to greet us in a very perky and genuine way. We ordered, she clarified some questions we had and off we went to find a place to sit.\n\nWe walked past the one table there, three guys having a very boisterous conversation about things boisterous guys tend to speak too loudly of in public. Rather than sit too close so they could hear our pre-food/eavesdropping commentary/mocking, we moved off to the side, with no fewer than 6 TVs in view. Each one had something different on, unfortunately though, there were no subtitles, so we had to make up our own lines for the shows.\n\nWhile looking for a seat and waiting for our food, we noticed that just about every table was dirty and still had the number tag on or under them.\n\nOur food came out and WOW that burger looked and smelled amazing. Did not expect a burger as grandiose to be set before me. The basket of fries and sturdy steak knife filled the rest of the table. Luckily, there were no other people sitting near us, so it was easy to slide to another table and steal their condiments, as the ones on our table were all empty.\n\nIt took some time, but the food was consumed, hands and face were messy (Carls Jr would be proud, it was ALL over the place, so it definitely belonged in my face) and my stomach was satisfied.\n\nI enjoy dipping my fries in 1000 Island dressing and their 1000 had a lot in common, flavor-wise, with tartar sauce. Which is also good to dip fries in, just not what I was expecting.\n\nWould have been 5 stars if I was only judging the food quality itself. However, $21 for two burgers and one drink is a little high, in my opinion. It was a high quality burger, competing with Badger Cafe for my favorite build your own burger, burger. Badger still edges them, as my built burger at BC is the base price for a bare burger here.\n\nAlso, the disaster that was dirty tables EVERYWHERE was a bit disappointing. However, with only one front of house person and possibly a huge rush before we got there, it wasn't like a hurricane of food was left everywhere, just crumbs, numbers, smears on the tables, etc. \n\nOn our way out, we had no less than five people from our table to the door of the casino greet us and wish us a good evening. It was getting a little disconcerting having friendly, courteous staff in Vegas establishments that were not Mom & Pop owned. In a good way, for sure though!", "type": "review", "business_id": "aZcFXgb64zg6Z6iLGMC3OQ"}

Thrilled to check it out after catching wind of the sandwich special of the day. \n\nWe walked up and ordered the caprese sandwich and the Mr. G...or Super G...something like that. Only drawback from this visit was attention from the staff. Not a huge deal, but it was a little difficult to get a word out of them, or even get them to pay attention to the fact we were trying to order. \n\nThe caprese was perfect. Loved the bread it was on and the mozz, basil, and balsamic were top notch. Nice touch with the tomato spread, too. The sandwich I ordered was just ridiculous. London broil, jalapeno bacon, balsamic reduction and a few other nice accoutrement to enhance texture. Needless to say, it was a mammoth sandwich. Check out my photo. Only downside was when it was all gone, haha. \n\nI'm very much looking forward to heading back to The Bodega. Great sandwiches and selection of other items, too.

Ladies be careful with those heels! \n\nI've been here a few times with a friend, a group and my family. Each time the service was great. The waiters and waitresses are attentive, as are their assistants. When I went with my family, we were taken care of more by him than the waitress. Shout out to Junior! He was awesome. \n\nThe food was wonderful! When my family went, that was their first time and they were very satisfied with the food. We ordered dish after dish. I ordered Patatas Bravas, Artichoke Toasts, Ceviche, Fries, and Mac N Cheese, which is SO good. I don't know the sauce they use repetitively in different dishes, but it is so tasty!  The portions are small, unless you order the Parmesan fries or an entree, but you can't beat the price and smaller portions means more food. Of course their Sangria is delicious! My mom and I enjoyed our glasses. We ordered the Sparkling Sangria and it was sweet and fruity. \n\nAll in all Firefly is a great place. The location and service is great and food is full of flavor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "slA5uWvSAe4o362wgJrE6g"}

But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying, there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out, it ain't gonna be easy to get in.\n\nKabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta, Goyemon, Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar, I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal. \n\nI was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake, a small cucumber salad with sea snail, and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences, but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served, you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.\n\nDessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months, a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi, ice cream, or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating, the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused, he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching, and very delicious.\n\nTo be quite honest, I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor, Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi \"joint\" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese, please, turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AYbUb5UcAngroJ6uJG7tLQ"}

They'd probably be in fields such as Muppet Engineering or Bagel Architecture, though.  Huh?  What I'm saying is, even though I've eaten a lot of fish and rice over the years, a sushi expert I am not, but I absolutely enjoyed my dining experience at Kabuto.  Both times.  In the same week.\n\nI'm not going to say this is \"real\" sushi since I have nothing to back that up with, but I will say that this is the first Edomae style sushi I've had.  Your meal is paced much, much slower than an AYCE restaurant, with only one item being served to you at a time.  Each piece of nigiri is prepared in front of you, with the sushi chef telling you about the fish and its country of origin.  Everything being served has gone from the ocean to Kabuto's kitchen in a span of 24 hours or less.  You can start calling at 3:30pm to see what fish has been delivered for that day.  You may even be able to sweet talk them into saving specific items for you!\n\nAt Kabuto, quality is king, and it will leave a lasting impression on you.  Every piece of fish I've had since has been compared to Kabuto, and I can't see myself dropping that comparison anytime soon.  The only real solution is to get back to my sushi studies by going back to Kabuto.  This is one class that I won't mind repeating.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AYbUb5UcAngroJ6uJG7tLQ"}

This was despite the many dishes that were very strange. By strange I mean not good....what is this???? and why would this taste this way??? I am not sure how one could mess up penne pasta with Greek dressing or orzo pasta but they managed to make it inedible. Many things looked pretty dry and maybe not from today. The cook staff loading things in using their fingers is a little unappetizing too. Like another review said, maybe they could make it if they took out two buffets and just had two. Then they could focus on the better dishes. The straw that made them get 1 instead of 2 stars was that they charge you $1 for each tap water they serve your table.... Really? $6 for tap water for our table. I admit I am very picky but my husband is not. His motto is quantity over quality. And he said we will not go back. I would rather have one dish cost $10 or more and have it be really good than have 70 ok or inedible dishes. I hope to hear that they shorten the buffet and focus on quality.

I had a chicken and bacon club which had huge chunks of chicken that was so over cooked it was hard to bite through, and bacon that was so fatty I needed to deconstruct the sandwich to pull out most of the fat/bacon.  The herby fries were brilliant, though.  Some of my friends ordered salads which were huge, but from what I saw looked mostly like *lots* of lettuce and not a lot else.  The flip side is that the food is really reasonably priced.\n\nI also liked how family friendly it is here - I believe they had a microwave in the corner for mums to be able to heat up food for their kids.  I think that's great because kids can be picky and I'm sure it's much easier to just be able to bring your own food than hope the restaurant can prepare something they'll like.  \n\nSo I would definitely come back and drink more mojitos and eat more herby fries, but would view the rest of the menu with caution.", "type": "review", "business_id": "66_04nEOBGN6FSpiNt5aSA"}

Although living in Southern California, we seldom go to Las Vegas.  The last time we were in LV, it was 2009 and this restaurant was not here, I believe.\n\nWow, we like it a lot that we went twice during the 3 days we were in LV.  Dishes were so good.  They have a 'BALANCED' taste.  The sweet is not too sweet, the salty taste is not too salty, and the sour taste is not too sour.  I don't know how to describe it but they taste well balanced.\n\nThe sign of good food is that you can't stop eating.  That's how it was with my experience.  Every bite was followed by another bite since I wanted more and more.  We finished all of our lunch order dishes. For us the best one was the Crispy Oyster Mushroom with Lemongrass sauce.  Because of this dish, my husband wanted to go back to the restaurant instead of trying other vegan places in LV.  I did try bravely to have the seaweed stems.  Surprisingly, they were good.  The Crispy Eggplants and Crispy Beef dishes were also delicious but we prefer the Crispy Oyster Mushrooms dish.\n\nThe price was also so reasonable for lunch specials.  The service was attentive and friendly.  I wish that I can try more dishes before we left but we only have one stomach and only a few chances to dine here.\n\nWe will come back to this place again when we have a chance in the future.

My wife and I visited yesterday, and while we were very impressed by the location -- really beautiful spot -- the dining/drinking experience itself was less than satisfactory:\n\n1. TOO EXPENSIVE: The food is overpriced by $2-3 per plate. We don't mind paying for good food (Customshop and Five Church are favorites), but the portions and flavor profile has to justify the high cost, and they didn't for us. We felt we were helping to pay the investors back for the huge, beautifully-appointed restaurant.\n\n2. FOOD (2.5 Stars out of 5): So, what about the food itself? The menu was impressive, and we were excited to try a number of small plates (since you can't access a menu online, we're going from memory):\n\n---- Beer Cheese and Warm Pretzels (4 Stars out of 5): The best thing we ate - five or six warm, long/slender pretzel bread with a piping-hot triangle of beer cheese. We'd recommend adding some salt to the pretzels and continued work on the cheese - fairly one note - but compared to everything else, satisfying enough.\n\n---- Ahi Tuna & Seaweed Salad (2.5 Stars out of 5): This likely would have been a four star dish, but our server noted that they were having trouble deciding whether they could do it for us, and its clear they didn't have enough tuna to serve a full portion. The way its served is as bite-size portions (with dollop of salad) on small forks situated in a unique display with seven slots. Ours came out with just five forks of tuna, and at $14, it was a crazy-small amount of food. It tasted okay - I do a better version of it myself, and with about 3oz of tuna total, we were very let down.\n\n---- Duck Quesadillas (1 Stars out of 5): Yikes. These were not very good at all. Very small portion with just a little smoked/prepared duck in each one. We wish we hadn't ordered this. \n\n---- Flatbread Pizza (2.5 Stars out of 5): So, which flatbread pizza did we order? Well, we tried to have the jerk chicken pesto, which sounded delicious. And since we were still so hungry after the first round of food (the three dishes above were so insubstantial, we had to order a pizza) we started to wolf it down when it was delivered without inspecting its ingredients. But 5 minutes later, another server came by with what looked like our pizza (\"that's right, this was supposed to have pesto!\") making us look down at what we were eating. My wife doesn't eat beef, pork or lamb, and I'm pretty sure we were eating the one with bacon. It was tasty, but my wife wasn't too thrilled with eating bacon when she's so cautious to avoid it. \n\n3. THE BEER (2 Stars out of 5): I never understand when a brewery tries to have a dozen different beers on hand. Why? Assclown does this as well, and its a rookie mistake IMO. Find 4-5 beers you can produce well and do those only. We did a flight, and I have to say that I'd likely only order a couple again - the Peach Hefe was quite good, and likely our reason to go back.\n\n4. THE SERVER (2.5 Stars out of 5): We were seated upstairs, and our server had to comment every time she came up about what a trek it was to walk upstairs. Well, yea, I know, but come on, don't make me feel badly for you having to wait on me. Also just too talkative -- clearly, they are still getting their act together being open for such a short amount of time. But we had 9 different people stop by our table, and obviously the flatbread pizza mix-up... I'd prefer one server, not a team.\n\n5. Overall (2.5 Stars out of 5): I'm giving such specific notes because I want this to be a great brew pub. The backdrop is stunning, but just because it looks great doesn't mean people are going to come back if they have an uneven first visit.  Looking at the burgers and sandwiches, that appears to be how one should experience the food. And some of the beers were standouts. Work on the cost/portion size, slim down to a narrower number of high-quality beers, and make sure your servers are experienced. I started at 2 stars, but I'll upgrade to 3 stars as encouragement to keep at it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_YCwkkdiW5KliTK8g8Tlew"}

Not what it seems. I think all three of those headlines qualify...\n\nPizza-U (you guessed it, right next to Concordia) has space to eat inside, but really is built to be a take-out Pizza place. The twist? All they sell are individual-sized pizzas, cooked on a roller system similar to what you might see at Quizno's. Toppings are generous and the size seems just right - for $7-8 you get something that is right on the mark  in terms of quantity and taste. They have a variety of specialty flavors if you're into that, but I'm really only here to report that the basics - pepperoni, deluxe, hawaiian - are all present and delicious. In particular, they do a really good hawaiian which is a bit surprising given how little-seen they are on the east-coast. Food cooks pretty fast; students shouldn't have a problem eating there.\n\nThe only downsides right now? One is that it may be hard to spot. The business seems pretty new and is on the second floor above a pair of vegetarian gigs. The kitchen and staff work at the back end, so from the outside it appears empty apart from a logo poster on the window. That should probably improve with time. The other? Eat fast. The pizza is a thin crust, individually sized, so you can expect it to get cold within 20 minutes, even in the box.\n\nLong term, I think the only problem for Pizza U is a question of food-per-dollar. There's no $5 options for the students used to hitting the by-the-slice places. But if you have a couple of extra dollars to spend, this is a good lunch-time option.", "type": "review", "business_id": "77Y-BrPPVPf0wANgAtEiwQ"}

It's nice to find a place that will make it dirty when asked, instead of skimping on the olive juice. Always a plus for us is a strong, free wi-fi connection. Just ask your server for the password.\n\nFor our appetizers, our table had the tomato bisque soup, onion rings, and the red fresno pepper poppers. The soup was very creamy and thick, and the goat cheese was a great added flavor. The poppers brought some extreme heat to the table. These aren't your wimpy Sonic jalapeno poppers. The onion cream cheese filling cut the heat a bit with a nice tang, but be warned, these things pack a punch! As to the onion rings, I won't call them a \"miss\", but they were just so-so after the other two great offerings.\n\nVarious burgers were ordered along with some sandwiches.

That experience starts from the moment I get out of my car. For starters, the moment I opened my car door before stepping out, I was met with a \"hey big man (I'm a big man), you help me out with some change for the bus?\"  Mind you, I parked right in front of the place so this is definitely a demerit against them as they have every right and responsibility as a business to prevent this sort of thing from happening. It's not like I have a phobia of homeless folks, but there's nothing like having a filthy greasy booze-breathed hobo greet me at my car on my way into a restaurant  to whet the appetite.\n\nOnce I give the guy some change, I walk in to this typical strip mall Chinese take-out style eatery and am immediately greeted with \"for here or to-go?\" From across the room. When I'm ordering, I ask if they have unsweetened Iced tea. She doesn't know, she asks the girl right next to her who ignores her. We stand there for 20 seconds of silence before a man walks out and lists off the iced teas. I ask, \"Are they all sweetened?\" He lists them all off again. He didn't understand the question. I get it, this is America and there will be times where you run across a foreigner and cannot understand their language, I'm in their place, so I nod and ask for water. The first bottled water I receive had been previously opened. I tell them and they look at me like I'm crazy before getting me a new bottle. \n\nWhen the food arrives, the server places the largest plate of chicken katsu I've ever seen on the table in front of me. I would have been extremely impressed by this had I not ordered the beef with broccoli. I tell the server and I get the same look like I'm lying or something. Finally the beef with broccoli arrives on a large plate accompanied by a second large plate covered in steamed rice. Looks good! It was NOT! \n\nFirst of all, I was given a large spoon to eat my beef with broccoli. At this point, I don't feel like getting another look, so I pretend that I am accustomed to eating broccoli with a spoon and I smile and say thank you. Then I take the first bite. DISGUSTING!  It tasted like pounded beef fat covered in pure oyster sauce dipped in salt. The broccoli was a bit overcooked and every so often while hovering over my plate to prevent lap spillage, I get a whiff of some foul stank feet. No, it was not me, it was the plate. I have worked in enough short order kitchens to recognize that scent. It's filthy dish water. I was so appalled that I bothered to write this review. I would not have normally bothered to write a review of a strip mall place, but it was so gnarly that I want to prevent anyone from going to China One.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mThyP-DoLN3Y4UK7YM9uFg"}

You started off so well. My boyfriend and I were up early enough to go check out Squash Blossom, a place that has long been on my \"To Try\" list-mostly because of the allure of pumpkin pancakes. We're not typically early risers on the weekend so this was a treat.\n\nUpon our arrival, we were greeted by two different servers who both said they'd be with us momentarily. A third person (whom I presume to be the manager) approached us to see if we'd been helped and when we said yes, muttered something along the lines of \"ok, that's their job anyway\".. Red flag number 1? Another girl told us that only brunch was available which was unbeknownst to us--not a criticism, we just had not seen that there was Sunday Brunch. It seemed like an awfully good deal! $10 all you can eat WITH a drink? We just decided to go with it, not knowing if we'd still be able to get the aforementioned pumpkin pancakes. Finally, we were seated and quickly served coffee and water while we grabbed some plates and ventured off into breakfast land. \n\nInside, there were a variety of fruits and pastries, along with some lunch items. In the outdoor area, there was eggs, breakfast meats, and an omelette station. There weren't a whole lot of vegetarian options and the omelette station (which consisted of one guy and a few skillets) seemed pretty busy. I didn't want to go into a diabetic coma from just eating tons of sugary pastries, so I opted for some eggs, potatoes, biscuit, what little fruit was available and a mini cinnamon roll. It was a bit disappointing considering their main menu appears to have a lot more veg-friendly items. \n\nLet me just start off by saying, this food was not spectacular by any means. It was akin to a buffet at a family reunion you're forced to attend where half of the food is cold and/or burnt. \n\nI know what you're thinking right about now.. \"well Natasha, why didn't you say anything?!?\" Well I would've-but notice the title of this review. Nonexistent table. NO ONE willingly would come by our table to check up on us. It seemed like our server looked right past us and attended the other tables. Even if he was supposed to be the guy that brought us our drinks, I noticed that we were the only table no server checked on at all. It was actually borderline offensive. I mean, we ran out of coffee and water for a long time and finally managed to flag someone down for a refill. The girl that gave us more coffee and water was sweet and apologized because they were so \"flustered and busy\". Afterwards, the man I presume to be a manager approached our table, not to ask how things were, but to ask if he could take one of our chairs for another table. Let me add that this guy has zero customer service skills. Not too sure if there's a friendly bone in this guy's body.\n\nThe boyfriend and I were a little confused at this point. The servers are running around like chickens with their heads cut off, there's the presumed manager being a jerk to everyone. We wondered if they were understaffed? It certainly was not *that* busy the entire duration we were there. It was also a buffet and it appeared that they had a dedicated food runner. The only responsibility of the servers would be checking on customers and making sure drinks were filled. \n\nFinally, we were ready to leave and almost contemplated a dine n dash because the people working were *that* inattentive. I flagged down manager guy for the check and he practically scoffed at me when I said I wouldn't be paying in cash. If it's such a problem to pay with a credit card, how about becoming a cash only establishment? It seemed like even if I would've expressed my discontent for the entire experience, no one would have cared. \n\nAfter reading several reviews of this restaurant, I can see that there has long been problems with getting good service here. I do see that the business owner does respond to some reviews but if the same issues are happening that were going on based on reviews from a year ago--there hasn't been much effort made in improving \"based on customer's feedback\". \n\nI will NOT be returning. I suspect this restaurant only stays open because of it's close proximity of Matt's Big Breakfast, which always has a long wait on the weekends.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oHwkJgs5Fi0HuUISgtz_Gw"}

Where do i start? Oh ya so....Bobby Q messaged me after my last expierience apologizing about my food and explained they had the wrong oil delivered and to please come in ask for him and see their real \"hospitality\". I thought his message was awesome so tonight i called asked for the owner and a girl answered the phone and seemed soooooo nice told me the owners werent there and so i asked to place a to go order again (and thought well if they dont know im a yelper they will show their real colors!!!!! omg and that they did) i made my order for myself and my hubby and then asked if they had a childrens menu she very politely replied \"oh no! But what a great idea thanks\" (super sweet right) So i get there and walk in and its the same ghost town no body in sight only this time there wasnt even a bartender to ask...but when i walked into the bar area after waiting a while at 8:57pm I peaked around the corner into the kitchen and saw a girl (later to be named stephanie) on her cell phone. So i wait some more and decided to give up so i called my hubby to see if he wanted something different to eat and while i was explaining to him \"i dont know how im suppose to give a good yelp reveiw when history repeats itself\" Stephanie walks out ..i finished my conversation with \"gotta go babe she finally came out\"  Stephanie storms over to me and loudly says \"oh, I finnally came out huh\" i was just blown away i asked what the problem was she told me i was rude for saying that because she had just walked out of the back and i was lying about waiting but maybe i should go yelp about that!  I told her to check her cameras and told her i dont need her attitude and to keep the food im leaving. Then cassie ran out to me and begged for me not to leave( while stephanie was screaming running around the resturant saying how i had been there before i was that B*tch who wrote the yelp review and she didnt need to take my Sh*t) cassie told me she had made my food and was new there and she apologized for stephanies behavior told me she doesnt know what is wrong with her and after about 5 mins i came in handed stephanie my money (STUPID) took my food and cassie walked me out and apoogized again and as she was doing that this Crazy girl opens the door and asks me if i want my 36cents change (i thought she was going to throw it at me) i told her to keep it and told cassie i was going to try not to write a reveiw but contact the owner....sooooo i get in my car and feel bad for not tipping cassie so i walked back in to her and heard stephanie on her phone saying \"i dont need this sh*t and your the one who told her to come back\" so now i question how sincere the owners response was to me and how sincere they are at all HOSPITALITY!? What a joke! I tipped cassie and left.  The Food you ask ? lets just say this couldve been a great review update  to bad so sad... jealousy  or something is what i chop it up to with stephanie she was soooo nice both times on the phone til she saw me sorry not everyone is as blessed as me that doesnt mean you have to treat us like sh*t! They might have fixed the food problem but they need to work on there night time hospitality...sorry cassie i will NEVER be back!

He said it was one of the best breakfast places in town. His claim for Morning Squeeze's greatness was supported by how busy the place was and the amount of people waiting for a table. Unfortunately, Morning Squeeze did not come close to what I expected.\n\nOur group of four was put on the waiting list with a estimated wait time of 20 min. After close to the 30 min mark I asked the hostess what the status was on our wait and she said we STILL had two groups on front of us. What we didn't realize is we would of waltzed right in and sat at the bar to order. The hostess could of done a better job by either giving us a more realistic time table, giving us a heads up on how many groups of equal size were in front of us, and/or recommending to us to sit at the bar (provided there was space for four people). Ultimately, we found space for three at the end of the bar. I chose to stand because we did not want to wait any longer and I still had hope the place would redeem themselves via the food.\n\nThe servers behind the bar were moderately attentive during our meal. We placed our order for food and drinks with no issue but the next problem was how long the food took to get to us, which was about 20-25 min. I'm a pretty patient person but the wait to sit combined with the wait for food was unacceptable. This is also considering the fact I saw people who came AFTER us get their food first (it looked like one of the workers who might of been the manager of the place knew these people personally). The lachs/lox (smoked salmon) omelette I ordered was good  and my friends seemed to think the food was average for the price ($7 yogurt and granola parfait? really?).\n\nIn the end, the ambiance of the restaurant is what I feel attracts people. It seems trendy. You can sit outside and also bring your dog. The female servers are dressed like they just got done with a Crossfit workout session (low-cut workout tank top, yoga pants, and running shoes)...but all of that doesn't cover-up the poor service or average food.

I haven't found dumplings like this anywhere else in Phoenix. They are salty and savory and delicious. So good, we ordered a second plate. We finished up with the red curry. This is supposedly the spiciest thing on the menu, but I didn't find it that spicy. It really was kind of a just okay curry. Could have been a tad bit thicker and had a little more flavor.

A few key points:\n- my friend & I were kind and courteous upon our visit. To your credit, you did deliver our order to the car. However, in an attempt to make small talk and share our excitement of finding your \"fine\" establishment, you were, at best, lackluster! \n- Being featured on a show does not mean that your food is awesome. As is evident by the vast numbers of \"celebrity chefs\" whose cuisine leaves MUCH to be desired. Nor does 20 years in the game offers any solace to my palate. It merely means (as is evident by your defensive tone) that you refuse constructive criticism and continue to in your wayward fashion of cookery & culinary discourse....regardless of customer feedback.\n- I make my own \"everything\"... Salad dressing, ketchup, sausage, hamburger blend, pasta, BBQ SAUCE!!!...EVERYTHING! Great customer service definitely is NOT implying that your client base eats poorly. You're talking to a self proclaimed \"food snob\"! I Eat Well, everyday...even if i must make it myself! Your sauce, simply put, was horrible. \n- Canned greens would offer you an excuse for them being as bad! So now, as I understand it, I was served over cooked, week old greens. Great. That definitely makes the experience better....or NOT!\n- Just left San Diego. There's a tiny little place there that serves the best BBQ I've had in years!!! The line was through the door. Every table was filled (8 tables - at best). And they've never been featured on any fancy show. Simple: they do what they do WELL! And the customer service is stellar! \n- The male ego is indeed great. But humility strengthens the character of a man. \n- Thanks for the invite, but nothing could ever make me subject myself to such torture. I'd rather lick the walls of an abandoned brothel. \n\nThanks, bye & be well!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qG3eRlKLXbnWc1unu-0Yjg"}

What disappointed me about this place was the food could have been a lot better.  The direction and thought are somewhat there but plate ware and good service is not enough.  Summerlin needs some GOOD Japanese restaurants whether traditional or fusion it doesn't matter, just some good food.\n\nThis starts with sourcing and using good quality ingredients.  Don't dumb your menu down for the masses, put more effort into what you do and use this as a starting base.  Don't be like Firefly's, yes they are busy but the food sucks.  Aim to be better.  What is lacking here is an intelligent approach to cooking and creativity.  Reinventing or attempting contemporary Japanese dishes is not going to impress anyone.\n\nSalmon appetizer - Horrible...mushy with no textural component and tasted it like it was marinated in Mirin.\n\nHamachi Belly Shooters - Scrap this idea all together it's been done over and over again for 2 decades and it is not interesting.  Flavors were so so.\n\nKorean Chicken - This was good, liked the use of thighs and crispy chicken skin.\n\nRaw Tuna Dishes - Use fresh tuna not frozen.  Poke Express gets away with this, but the flavors are spot on.  A Japanese Tapas place should be using fresh product.  Yeah it is expensive but that it what you do.\n\nWagyu Sliders - Not bad, but nothing creative or significant.  \n\nPork Belly - Not bad as well, but even the pork belly at Inaba was better.\n\nLomi Salmon Caprese - Scrap this it doesn't do anything for the palate.\n\nTako dishes - Gotta use better quality tako.  The flavor of the dishes is a definite start but needs further development. \n\nI get what they are trying to do here and I hope that they improve on it.  That is what would probably bring me back.

I only found out because one of the girls in our group read it somewhere from USA Today (Food section)! As we got there, the line was already rows and rows filled so we decided to suck it up and wait the 1.5-2hr wait. When we finally got in, we paid the hefty fee of (45$ each) and got seated. We quickly ordered our drinks and ran to the buffet lines to see this \"extensive\" menu. I couldn't believe my EYES to see SOOO much food available. I made my way towards the seafood area which had snow crab legs to shrimp cocktails and even oysters. After that, I wanted to get some surf & turf so I went to the red meat area which I got my brisket, sausages, prime rib, etc. I thought that would be the end until I saw another room around the corner that had Italian, Asian and even a noodle bar where the chef made fresh Japanese ramen (which is to DIE for and surprisingly very good for a buffet), pho, and udon. This new buffet is literally the land of gluttony and our table was no exception. This buffet did remind me a bit of the Wicked Spoon for their aesthetic designs of their dishes such as their fried chicken and waffle came in vintage baskets and pots. \n\nEven after consuming all these savory dishes, we had to try their dessert menu; There's ALWAYS room for dessert! The dessert menu however wasn't as extensive as I thought it would be but they had some delicious gelato selection. The one that stood out the most was their strawberry. It literally tasted like the strawberry gelato that I had in Florence, Italy! It was that comparable. They also had macarons, crepes, assorted candies (swedish fish), and tiny cake pops.\n\nMy expectations for Vegas buffet are not that high for 1 main reason: Too much different food doesn't equate to good refined food because there's too many different options plus when you mass produce food, you skimp out on quality. But rest assured, this buffet offers QUALITY. I'm just hoping that the quality of the buffet wasn't at its best just because it was the opening weekend. I hope this quality is here to STAY!\n\nAnother nice plus was that the President of Caesar's sat right behind our table making sure that the buffet was operational at good standards and even greeted our table and introduced himself and bought a round of drinks for us.

A rep is there ready to take your empty plate and quickly cover it with warmed crab legs.  I think it was snow crab and not king crab although I like both.  I really liked their roast duck in the Asian station.  It wasn't dry as my friends had feared.  The best item at the buffet was clearly the steak--very flavorful!

Desserts are also not cloyingly sweet, and it cools off the palate comfortably, rather than a shock of sugar. Macarons (blueberry, pistachio, coffee, and orange) are flavored from the filling; the outside shell is all the same almond flavor, just colored differently so do note that. \n\nThings I don't recommend, since some things are not as awesome (understandably so, as there is a LOT of stuff to eat). I would not get the sushi, as it is mostly rice and not much else. The seaweed has an overly fishy taste to it, and some of the sides were not that great (guacamole is only meh). Of course, these are all rather minor, and rest assured that the main stars of the show are all as delicious as they look (meats and seafood). Dessert-wise, everything was pretty decent, but I did not like the custard cups (one is passionfruit and the other is some blue-purple cup-boysenberry or blackberry?) and some of the ice creams seemed a bit diluted (thai tea had barely any flavor). \n\nIf I were to go again--rather, if I want to bust my pants again (6 plates, 4 dessert this time), I would attempt to binge less on desserts and load up on more seafood.

The first time I tried to eat here for brunch they told me to come back in three hours.  Whhattt?  Well now that I have eaten here I can say I went, and ate and prob won't eat here again.  Pluses for their ticket system that cuts down on the frustrating standing in line experience.\n\nThe seafood was average.  Yes, there were crab legs. And yes, you can get them STEAMED in the Asian section.  There were also oysters (not so good), mussels, ceviche, shrimp and shellfish in various sauces.  The seafood didn't rock my world.\nTheir were some smaller individual sized food like wagyu beef burgers and sea bass.  The sea bass with bok choy was actually one of my fav stand out dishes.  Totally unexpected, but the dim sum in the Asian section was perfectly steamed and delicious (and they wrapper of their hargow didn't stick or break when you tried to eat it).  Other things I liked: individual wedge salads, heirloom tomato salad, steamed crab legs, rack of lamb, and mashed sweet potato.  \n\nI skipped the Mexican area, most of the Italian, and the majority of the carving station other then the lamb. I know I know, but I hate not having room for dessert. I also wasn't in an 'eat until you feel sick' mood, lol.  I will say that the dessert was as amazing as everyone said.      \n\nMy favs: 1) mango chili lime gelato. Wow what a refreshing combination of flavors after all the mini meal-type dishes I had.  2) macaroons. Enough said.  3) green tea red/bean cookies.  I actually got these thinking it was pistachio, but I was like oohhh is this red bean?  Win!  I mean there were so many desserts that you'd get a stomach ache trying them all.

They have cold and HOT crab legs. If you want them hot go to the Italian station at the other end of the buffet where you see some cooks making pizza. Ask the guy next to the big pots.\n\n- The line for the taco bar is very long so it's best to get a couple or don't plan on coming back.\n\n- Make sure you don't get an end piece of prime rib.

We were all impressed.   We all were very pleased with our meals and the bleu cheese and bacon fries were delish.   We had a very friendly, attentive and personable waiter in Trevor.   You need to experience Dlux, you will not be disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r4HOnHnQWKaq0e7dlP1fRA"}

I chose this restaurant solely on the great Yelp reviews, so maybe my particular experience was just an unlucky one. That said...I won't be coming back.\n\nThe evening started off kind of shaky. Service was very slow to greet, and we felt like we'd been handed off back and forth between waitstaff from the outset of the meal. Waitress was definitely spread thin, and we felt rushed to put in our full order from the get-go. Personally, I like to eat my appetizers before ordering main dishes, but it seemed like this was not an option. So after waiting about 15 mins after getting our drinks, we were finally able to order. The app was great, we had the Baked St. Andre Cheese. AMAZING but we ran out of bread quickly. We ordered more...but it never came...waited for it but the cheese was getting cold, so we just ate the cheese and cancelled our order. Strike ONE.\n\nWe soon received our main dishes, the filet and the scallop entrees respectively. Scallops were great, 10/10. The steak, which we ordered medium rare, was uncooked...not undercooked, but practically BLUE in the middle. We sent it back immediately and got some cheese puffs, the night's amuse bouche, to hold us over. When we got the steak back after a good amount of time, it still wasn't cooked properly, but we were tired of waiting at this point and just decided to deal with it. STRIKE TWO.\n\nFinally, dessert comes and it is a birthday dessert, which was a deconstructed goat cheese cake. I know this is an experimental restaurant, but this was a failed experiment for sure. However, since it was a free dish, and of course everyone's taste is different, I wasn't too upset. \n\nWhat did bother me, though, was when a waitress grabbed our UNFINISHED bottle of wine off the table before we could get a word in, and immediately threw it in the trash. We were definitely planning on finishing it or at least taking the corked bottle home. STRIKE THREE.\n\nThere was one more thing that bothered me. When I got the check, I saw that we were charged for the cheese puffs sent out by the kitchen when we sent back our undercooked steak. I brought this to the waitress' attention and she quickly removed it, but not before making a remark about how \"the first ones are free but additional ones are extra.\" When I explained that we didn't order them, she rudely interrupted me to remind me that they were indeed removed from the check so it was a non-issue.\n\nPerhaps a one-off bad experience, but in this case; when it rains, it pours.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eXaVJc5GMIjYEUjbrc13FA"}

There are some parallel spots around the building, but at 5:00 on a Saturday, these were all full.   I drove around the block once to try and check everything out and ended up parking in one of the back-in spots (eek!) on Commonwealth.  When we left around 8:00, all spots everywhere were full - had I encountered that, I would have bailed and told her I caught a case of the plague.\n\nEven though we were meeting very early, I made reservations on Open Table on the off chance that everyone was going to be sick of family and turkey the Saturday after Thanksgiving and bum rush the place.  After 6:00ish, the place really picks up and they were slammed for the rest of the night that we were there.\n\nVery cozy ambiance, comfortable seating.  High top tables and chairs in the bar area, tales throughout the rest of the first floor.  I was seated immediately, even though I was early and the hostess asked if I wanted water and brought it back almost immediately.  Our waiter for the evening was Christopher (?) and he was right on top of things. \n\nMy dinner was the Turkey Lurkey, which was a turkey burger with sage mayo, craisins and.... I don't know.  It was good.  Served with a side, I chose the mashed potatoes, which were fine, but the turkey burger was awesome.  Well seasoned and extremely juicy, YUM.  My dinner date is a vegetarian and they made the Holiday Risotto veggie friendly by omitting the turkey.  We split the Oreo truffles for dessert (balls of smashed Oreos covered with chocolate), which was served with glasses of milk.  Deeee-licious and so rich.  \n\nWe sat there for a while eating and chatting.  Drinks were kept filled, our waiter was fantastic.

They also have filipino beer like Red Horse and San Miguel you won't find in your typical restaurant. \n\nMy party started off with the clam chowder in a bread bowl and calamari. The clam chowder came out cold. Barely room temperature. The calamari portions were surprisingly small for the price you pay and the calamari itself were small to boot. For the main course I ordered the crabcake sandwich with cajun fries. I believe you have to pay $1 extra for fries of your choice. The sandwich was good, but came out cold again making me wonder if it's made fresh. I guess I didn't mind since since eating cold crab isn't as bad as eating cold clam chowder. My friend had the fried shrimp with parmesan garlic fries. At first we thought they brought out the wrong fries, but upon closer inspection the fries were sprinkled with a little bit of parmesan and granulated garlic. I was expecting something along the lines of wing stops parmesan flavor they put on their wings. I barely could taste the difference between regular fries. The amount of fries they give you is small too. The shrimp on the other hand was pretty good. We ordered in cajun sensation and the shrimp were very large and came out piping hot. \n\nOur servers were really good. Checked on our tables often when we needed them and were nice people. \n\nDespite the short comings with the food I do want to return in a couple months because I want to support new small businesses. Hopefully by then the kitchen will be sorted out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nZww1gdBAi9HtRKiQHL2qA"}

The waitress showed the chef and I was asked if we wanted a new order but we declined.\n\n*** I orderd the Lobster Ramen only sadly to be told that they were out of Lobster - That sucked!!!! ***\n\nSo I settled on the Miso Ramen while adding Buttered Corn for $2.00 (which I think is too much $ for corn) and fried garlic.The noodles were perfectly firm and yummy- I enjoyed the noodles. The broth to me could've had more taste - I know that I could've added Soy Sauce ect... But I like eating food at a place that I'm paying for without having to add flavor.

I like the Spinach and all the add-ins. \nThe BF was a little turned off by all the add-ins while I on the other hand was turned on by it....\nI LOVE PICKELED PLUMS!!!! So I was happy to know that you get a pickled plum in your soup but I think they should've used seedless plums cause if your not careful you could hurt yourself chopping down on one.\n\nI was given a complementary scoop of their Black Sesame Ice Cream probably because of my raw gyoza. I am thankful though for the ice-cream. I liked the ice cream - yes it was different and a bit weird at first but once you get over the weirdness it's actually yummy....\n\nI think the prices of the appetizers should be cheaper though....\n\nSo while our first visit was OK I will return to Shoku Ramen-ya again and hopefully get to try the Lobster Ramen,Karage Chicken wings (even though I hate wings) and the fried rice looked good as well.

To the reader, I am not taking responsibility for your well being if you still choose to eat here especially after reading this review.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. I bring my wife and two boys. I order 4 pastor tacos for me and my oldest. A cheese quesadilla for my youngest, and an order of asada fries for all of us to share.\n\nSo the food comes out. It all looks good. But looks can be deceiving. You know when people say don't judge a good book by its cover. Well this cover looks good but once you read the first page, it will make you want to rip it in half and burn it.\n\nFor starters, the pastor was dry like it has been on the spit for days. That's really funny because there was oil literally pouring out of the tortilla when I pick it up. My guess is that they dipped it in hot oil before throwing it in the tortilla. I should of took pictures of the plate it was on because it was literally transparent from all the grease.\n\nThe quesadilla should of been called a \"greasadilla\". My youngest only took a couple bites before he had to stop because of grease running down his chin and fore arms. The tortilla itself was already soggy. \n\nAs for the asada fries I was hoping that would be the saving grace to this horrible experience so far. I was wrong. Boy was I wrong. I took a picture of it and posted it on here. It looks decent. But when we started eating it, we noticed they had used nacho cheese instead of shredded cheddar. For nachos that might be ok. But for fries that's a major no no. The meat was also greasy like they dipped it in oil to bring it to life. The only decent things about it was the sour cream and guacamole.\n\nWe ate or should I say tried to eat at least half of our food but it seemed like with every bite our stomachs were screaming bloody murder. But alas, we had to dump it in the trash. \n\nSo in closing, memo to \"Pepe\", can you please cut down on the grease and at least make the tacos just a tad bit bigger? Once you do that, then maybe I will give you guys another try.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Zd4fDGXFTnPP36_KDTuyhg"}

We investigated the menu online and our DD arrived with dinner shortly thereafter.  \n\nOOH LA LA  - I love a pleasant surprise!! It was a win!!!\n5 of us dined for $50 so a wee above average prices.  \n\nMom had an island burger and said through muffled bites, \"this is a pretty darn good burger!\"  Dad was quite pleased with his juicy burger and fries as well.  The fries are homemade so they are a hybrid fry/chip.  They are greasy but good.  The burger is stuffed with cheese.  I would have like to try a bite but sadly, there were no remains.\n\nAs for the rest of us, we shared the staples....kahlua pig with cabbage, kalbi, and kauai chicken with fried rice, noodles, mac salad, and white rice.  It was unanimous that the mac salad was the BEST we have ever had.  The white rice was delightful (which some may think is silly for white rice - but it is the good starchy short grain stuff).  The fried rice was very good; little treasures mixed in such as spam.  The noodles were meh.  I wouldn't order them next time.  The kahlua pig was perfect, the kalbi was fatty, tender and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly.  The chicken was described as beer battered but it has a very sweet crunchy batter.  I'm not sure what kind of glaze they add.  It was good - but a surprise.  \n\nI haven't seen the inside yet but I'm familiar with the small location in a little strip mall in front of Smith's.  A perfect spot for a diamond in the rough.  Our food getter did say she had to wait around 20 minutes for food.  I don't mind a wait if quality results are produced.  I considered stopping there last night on my way home from work but thought it might be too soon.

I have to say Angelina's has really stepped it off on service and the Pho has greatly improved. I don't know if this was a good day or if they are this good all the time since I don't come often enough to know. They also post a current Grade A Maricopa certificate on the front door.\n\nI got the Chicken Pho it was made with tender fresh white meat chicken. The broth tasted fresh made and was delicate with ginger and other flavors. I thought the broth had good flavors and I added the side plate of cilantro, Thai Basil, Jalape\u00f1os and lime. I didn't think I needed to add any sauces. At other places I have added sauces.  I ordered a large because it was only one dollar more than medium and I thought the medium might be too small but the large was way too much food for me. I don't know how much chicken they gave me but I couldn't eat it all. And I had enough noodles for four people I think. The very hot pho started to cook the chicken more and bring out the jalape\u00f1os to full strength. So you have to try to eat it as fast as you can because the chicken starts to dry out and the soup grows with too much spice. \n\nMy waiter was very sensitive and I almost offended him by leaving too many noodles in my dish. I insisted to him that it was very good and I was very full.\n\nMy husband had the rare beef and brisket pho. This time it was much richer with beef flavor than it was before and like the chicken pho it was very well seasoned. He said the rare beef also continues to cook but the brisket stays delicious and tender the whole time.\n\nI do note they only gave us one small plate of the cilantro and other toppings to share but the waiter did offer to give us a second plate so you might have to ask for a second plate if there are two or more of you having pho.\n\nIt really was good I have to come here more often!", "type": "review", "business_id": "CvufqyRBbS2Ed2wQlAXCMw"}

If you like this, then it is American Chinese.  Regular Chinese is things like steamed whole fish, or chicken on the bone with green onion, chicken feet, water spinach saut\u00e9ed in garlic.... These are more authentic Chinese that most people would not order or taste.\n\nThe help - Everyone here seems ethnically Chinese, from the front desk to the cooks and that is kinda rare nowadays.\n\nThe food -\n\nBrown Rice - Great choice and you can substitute the white rice with brown rice.  Much more healthy.  That is great stuff.\n\nBeef Chow Fun - The meat was thin, and very tender. Very tasty.  Noodles were thick and just the right fir mess.  good quality vegetables in it and a very nice portion.  I really enjoyed the taste and the texture of this dish.  We ordered two orders because everyone enjoys this.\n\nCurry Chicken - Just the right spice, lots of chicken and again, quality veggies.  Snow peas, mushrooms as well as your traditional celery, carrot and onion.  The spice on this was very mild, just right.  This is another one of our favorites and it did not disappoint.\n\nString Bean with Chicken - Nice. Good taste, lots of chicken and very tender.\n\nBeef Broccoli - Can't complain at all.  Very good, at same time, nothing special.\n\nTofu and Eggplant - one of the best.  the tofu is lightly fried.  Very nice.  I really enjoyed this and rarely order it.\n\nThe price - for basically 8 cartons of food (rice and all) in total, we paid 52.00.  Not too shabby.\n\nThe stuff - If you are taking out, don't forget to grab a handful of fortune cookies from the basket. The utensils, and condiments are near the soda fountain and you can take what you need.\n\nThe place - Clean, well lit, overall very welcoming and comfortable.\n\nGK says for American Chinese cuisine, be sure to try this place.

Yonaka did an impeccable job of bringing new flavors to traditional Japanese foods, incorporating fresh ingredients from around the world. \n\nWe tried the ten course tasting menu, ordering two sets for our table of six and were not disappointed!  Each dish was impeccable in taste and presentation. The meal built perfectly, nothing was too heavy so we could enjoy every course. The flavors were all unique, with combinations like Hokkaido scallops with strawberries, black pepper, and cilantro. Who knew how delicious that could taste?!!  Even the simple starter, watermelon with fish sauce and mint~ was perfect in taste and timing. The unique taste grabbed our attention and got us psyched to try whatever was coming next. There was blue fin tuna, yucca and kale chips, red radishes, grilled potatoes, delicate sauces all craftily combined for perfect bites. We had unique sashimi, flying fish included! All great. \n\nBy the 8th course, we were definitely getting full. The 9th course was a dashi/rice/egg/stew kinda delicious concoction, that easily filled up anyone who was somehow still hungry.  And the desserts were pieces of art (we had two different types, with many delightful combinations on each plate-- mango mousse and coconut, strawberry mint ice cream, green tea brownie, strawberry chocolate milk.... YUM). It wasn't too sweet, which our indulged bellies appreciated. \n\nThe decor is simple and elegant, service was timely, friendly, and each dish was explained thoroughly (a tough task with all those ingredients and courses)!\n\nAlso, the fresh ginger ale was perfect and helped me digest all the amazing food Yonaka served up!!  Thanks for a memorable meal!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HpaYCM_NCauI72LLXxC6SA"}

We agreed that we'd wait 2 more minutes before getting up and leaving.  After making eye contact with quite a few servers and bussers, as we were about to get up, our server came - without an apology, she asked what she could get us to drink.  We obliged and ordered.

My brother had the duck breast, and though I don't eat duck, he insisted I try it - it was better than my beef shoulder.  My SIL ordered the same thing I did, so nothing extra to comment on that.  The service throughout our meal was yet again, next to none.  We had to ask every time we wanted our drinks refilled - she never came by to ask how our meal was.  And when we did ask for refills, we actually felt bad because she made it seem like we were inconveniencing her.  \n\nYou know how it goes....whenever you receive bad service, it's almost hard for the food to taste good - you're just so bothered by the service that it doesn't matter.

Today, Sushic opened at the UNLV student union - a highly anticipated replacement for 2 failed spots in the past 5ish years between Taco Bell and Panda Express.\n\nNow, the food may just be A-OK compared to sushi restaurants off campus, but the fact that it is convenient, cheap, and healthy makes it a great alternative to all of the other places in the nearby area.  There is a case of rolls being made in the on-site kitchen in front of customers and then placed out for sale.  When I arrived at noon, rolls were constantly being assembled and placed past the case onto the counter before the cashier for additional options.\n\nA menu board on the back wall, which is hard to see when joining the line in front of the case, allowed for other items to be ordered and made to order.  I initially ordered a spicy salmon roll, but it turns out they had no salmon today.  I then ordered a spicy tuna roll (not too bad at $5.49 for 9 pieces) and noticed by the cash register there were hot items for sale not on the new menu.  These included bimibap (with fried egg), udon with kamaboko, and teriyaki chicken on rice with vegetables and salad.\n\nI ordered a bimibap and received the bowl with a side of gojuchang.  A few minutes of waiting and I got my spicy tuna roll which was inside out and luckily, it had no mayo: tuna, shichimi, and avocado on the inside wrapped with nori, rice on the outside with shichimi togarashi sprinkled on top.  This is nice and simple, considering many rolls in the case had goopy mayo sauces on them.\n\nThe bimibap for $7.99 was not too bad for something at the student union either: rice, cucumber, yellow bell pepper, shiitake mushrooms, daikon, lettuce, beef, and fried egg with plenty of gojuchang on the side.

The wait wasn't bad; There are noodles to watch, bubble teas to drink, and a pleasant staff to banter with. It's the sort of menu where you check off your order with a pencil.  Even so, things came out not quite as ordered (shrimp dumplings instead of pork, meat sauce instead of oyster).  But you know what?  It was all delicious so we didn't care.  The five-spice eggplant was particularly good.  We took the micro-managing of our dumplings, by various servers, with a grain of salt. Pittsburgh has been long overdue for a place like this.  Don't miss it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RjavzMXChoFWdsIZnfs5YQ"}

I thought everything was a cool experience for me because I have honestly never seen anything like this. \n\nSince I'm not very familiar with Chinese food like this I had a ton of questions on exactly what I was ordering. The waitstaff were very helpful and introduced us to some great eats. We ordered Wood Ears & Sliced Tofu kin appetizer which was very tasty and an ample size for two, keep this in mind when ordering that the noodles and dumplings are very large portion sizes so don't order too many appetizers or you will have to bring home food, we did.\n\nAs our main dish we tried the Braised Beef Noodle soup and Dan Dan noodles. The Braised Beef Noodles are in a huge bowl of broth with a ton of noodles. I loved the tenderness and subtle flavoring of the beef that was in the soup. The Dan Dan noodles are \"Dry Noodles,\" but don't let that be misleading you still get a hefty bowl of noodles that are coated in a sauce similar to a peanut sauce with a little bit of kick. \n\nI'm a big fan of Bubble Tea, and fortunately it is offered here and have to say that your options to customize your Tea to what you like are available. I have actually never had been offered so many options for my bubble tea.\n\nOn another note I wasn't sure if they offer forks for us lazy folks, but I suggest taking your time through your meal and sticking to using the chopsticks. I have never  used chopsticks for noodles and it was certainly an experience but fun and made our lunch stretch out a little longer than normal. But if you want a fork I saw some folks using forks on our way out.\n\nAnother cool thing is the dudes cranking out in- house noodles and dumplings,it sort of reminds me of making taffy. You should Check it out!", "type": "review", "business_id": "RjavzMXChoFWdsIZnfs5YQ"}

We ordered the soup dumplings, pan fried pork buns, and a pork belly 'slider'. I put Slider in quotes because the thing was quite massive...even between us two it was a struggle to eat it, but it was very good, as well as the pork buns. My only gripe was the soup dumplings were a bit of a letdown. While I though the texture and meat were nice, the broth was not good, at times tasting like dirty meat water or something.. (Don't ask me how I would even know what that tastes like) I was expected much more from the dumplings, and was a bit let down.

It also comes with cheddar cheese, black beans, and green chilies.  Surprisingly it's not as spicy as you would expect.  \n\nThe service was very friendly. We were greeted within second of walking into the place and were sat quickly.  Keep in mind we came at 9am so the traffic is very low.

Lucky me I was able to make it today. I drove right by it even when I knew where it was. The front is facing the parking lot and the side is facing 32nd street. \n\nWalked in and it seemed very casual. The decor is hard to describe. I would have to say homie. Staff is homie wearing normal clothes and nothing to separate them from customer. Unique. Anyways, we were greeted right away, seated with a smile, and our waitress welcomed us right away. Very nice. \n\nWe started off with their freshly squeezed orange juice. Room temperature with the pulp. Really good. Loved it. You also get one free refill. Make sure you get the refill. \n\nI realized that all these breakfast joints are all the same but what separates the good one from the great ones is their pancakes and French toast. Couldn't figure out which one to get today so I ordered the pancake special with blueberry pancakes, eggs, and sausage. I got two huge pancakes with blueberries inside and on top with maple syrup. Excellent pancakes. Nice fluffy. Really tasty with fresh blueberry. Couldn't ask for more. The eggs were good and the sausages thick and juicy. Really good breakfast. \n\nMy son had the Hog Heaven omelette. It had sausage, bacon, and ham with cheddar cheese. Very surprised he ordered a omelette but then again it had bacon and he loves bacon. He told me that it was really good. He's a very picky eater so when he says it's good then it must be really good. \n\nService was excellent. They already have a small jar of cold water at the table so you don't have to worry about refills. Only have to worry about orange juice refills which is a must. She was always asking us how are food was and kept an eye on us which was really good. \n\nSo overall this was really good. Excellent food, excellent service, and homie atmosphere. What else could you ask for. For sure I'll be back again to try their San Francisco style French Toast. Enjoy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t80qleqEIqIyekB95IrAOA"}

The parking lot was packed when we arrived, so I worried we might have to wait long for a table. Nope! Just a couple minute wait and we were on our way. Soon chips, salsa and bean dip were at our table. They also brought a side of grilled veggies! The salsa was alright, but could have been thicker for my preference. The bean dip was very good as were the chips. Our server mentioned they have excellent guacamole made table-side. The guac sounded good and I would be the only one trying it so, I asked for the small side priced at $3.95 on the menu. The small side of guacamole was not made table-side so I didn't get to choose any of the ingredients that went into the guac. It was just brought to the table already prepared. I didn't like it at all. it was just bland mashed avocados with way to many tomatoes in it. I would have liked some onion, jalapeno, salt and maybe even some lime, but I wasn't offered any. The kicker for me was when my food arrived and there was about the same amount of the same exact bland guacamole on my plate that I paid extra for prior. Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered the other, but the server also said it would be made table-side and to my customization.\n\nMy friend and I ordered \"Combo Fajitas For Two\" priced at $25.95 with beef and pork. This comes with a cup of \"Fideo Soup\" that is out of this world yummy. The soup really packed some delicious flavor. One thing that impressed me here is that a lot of the time when you order fajitas somewhere it usually is just meat and tortillas, but they actually gave a small side of sour cream, bland guacamole, pico de gallo and you can choose flour or corn tortillas. The meal also came with rice and beans that were very good. The fajitas were so-so for me. The meat is thicker than I am used to and was a bit tough and the bell peppers were still to raw and not cooked enough. My hubby ordered his own combo plate that had Chile Relleno and a Cheese Enchilada and thought it was good, but nothing to write home about. There were major hits and misses with the whole meal. Our server was very friendly and checked on us often. It was worth at least giving it a try! Will I come back? Not anytime soon, but I can see giving JFF another shot at some point maybe with a coupon.\n\nWhen you walk in the dining area is on the right and there is a cantina towards the left.

We sat at a small table next to the window near the Habachi tables. Only two of the six had people seatd around them.  My first thought upon seeing the \"waiter\" assisting the table next to us was, 'really?'  He appeared to have slept in his one and only outfit of worn jeans, old t-shirt and worn canvas shoes.  He also had a very large folding knife tucked into his front pants pocket and clipped to the lip of the pocket. Slouching, as if disinterested in taking the other couples order, he stood back away from the table as if the elderly couple would ruin his cool.  I begged he not be our waiter.   \n\nOur's was not much different though he was polite, and sans pocket knife.  I ordered my usual overdose of sushi, while my wife ordered something stirfry-ish indicated to be spicy from the menu.  It was not spicy and it was overly sweet.  My sushi was good except I believe the yellowtail had sat too long and wassn't as fresh as I had become accustomed to.\n\nThe bottom line is we were disappointed with our food, unimpressed with the casualness of the waitstaff, wondered what had happened to a great little asain bistro in such a short period of time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "n0GhxvBBR2i4dj_c3kmYHg"}

I've now been twice, first for food (thinking initially it edged more towards being a restaurant) as part of friends birthday gathering, and a second time for drinks only, strangely again as part of another friend's (different group this time) birthday.  Hmmm, maybe we could also file The Vintage in the '30 something's trendy birthday hangout' category too??...\n\nNonetheless, each time I've been impressed, both by the food on offer and by the selection of varying types of ales, lagers, stout and cider that they have too.. Haven't yet delved into the wine list....maybe there is room for a third trip soon perhaps?!...\n\nThe charcuterie menu is, as mentioned before, a great option if you feel like just grazing away whilst having a glass of beer or three.  Grab yourself a trendy steel bar stool, pull yourself up to the bar, run your hand over the fine chunky wooden bar top, and order yourself a sausage or two from the menu, crikey where am i going with this!?  Anyhow, what I'm saying is you'll enjoy sitting at the bar doing this just as much as you will diving in to a three course meal with all the trimmings at a private table (mixed table with chairs / table with benches are available too).\n\nThe charcuterie options are mouth watering (both meat and fishy, with some veggie options too). I chose a starter of two selections - fennel infused salami and a smoked haddock p\u00e2t\u00e9 spread served with chunky bread, each great, followed by a hearty steak with roast tatties and veg - cooked, medium rare to perfection, lovely!\n\nNow back to the beers, served in small glasses or schooners (2/3 pint) The Vintage claim the schooner sized glass to be the best way to serve a beer/ale/cider.  Pretentious maybe in the view of some, but I somehow sort of agree after initially thinking it might have just been a way to eek a penny or two more out of me for a less amount of beer?!  This is coming from a guy who perhaps doesn't down his beer as quickly as others - it means the last of your beer isn't warm and flat by the time you get close to the bottom of the glass.  It also helped me keep control on some of those 6.5% beers on offer!\n\nFour stars easily, possibly five but our bill at the end each time was edging on the slightly expensive side, however it still affords a great review as the selection on offer, both food and drink, is refreshing.  \n\nLastly, this place place fills quickly at weekends, we booked a table each time we went - full each time. Best advised to do so on Friday / Saturday evenings.

No sharing of this one, guys. It was SO flavorful and filling. Two characteristics I always look for in a burger.\n\nBut on Sunday, when we arrived for a post-church lunch, I had something different in mind. I ordered the udon noodles (no added meat).

Served with some soy sauce and Siracha on the side (yes, thank you!). \n\nWhat I appreciate is that Nom Nom serves up a killer burger (or at least that's what the carnivores tell me) as well as some Asian staples. They also have recently added sliders to the menu, which the Mr already has designs on for our next trip.\n\nI almost forgot! The edamame appetizer! Order it. You won't be sorry.

I figured Poshburger would've read reviews and fixed things.  After all, the owner is a Michelin-Star recipient...right???  That's all that I've read in all their PR.\n\nI was REALLY hoping that the 2nd time around would result in a 5-star rating!!!! \n\nWell, the two stars is basically based on great service from our server Sandra.  A very pretty Austrian gal who was the perfect blend of attentive-but-give-you-room-to-breathe server.\n\nI came with a buddy and we each ordered the Kobe.  This was my 2nd time trying this burger.  This time the foie gras was healthy-sized and it came to our table very attractively.  The couple to the next of us (uncomfortable due to the picnic tables) gawked at our burgers.  It looked great!!!\n\nUnfortunately, the burgers...again....came over-cooked.  I cut my burger in half and started eating.  I finished half of my burger when Sandra came around and checked on us.  I asked her whether my other half looked Medium-Rare and she said absolutely not.  She asked if I wanted a new burger and I said no....even thought the burger was very dry.  She asked again but I honestly didn't want to wait.  I did, however, appreciate her sincere concern.  Plus she was so pretty when she asked.  Haha.\n\nThe bun was so big in relation to the burger that I just removed the top bun.  My plate ended up as a big mess of overcooked burger and thick bread.  Sandra wasn't even sure whether my plate was ready to be cleared.\n\nI ordered the onion rings as a side  which was horrible.  Note to Michelin-Star chef...If you put onion rings inside a cone container, the rings will continue to cook in the steam and get soggy and the breading will fall off the onions!!!!  Any other decent restaurant that I've enjoyed good onion rings understands this and serves them open to allow the batter to adhere to the onions.  \n\nRocket science???  Poor understanding of Cooking 101???  Or an \"I don't give a shit\" attitude that's apparent in every other aspect of this restaurant??? \n\nThe restaurant was not very busy and I would be very surprised to see Posh remain open for long.  \n\nOn a side note...I personally would've comped something for the admittedly overcooked burger.  A glass of wine.  A dessert.  A side.  Something!!!  The owner was there in the kitchen.  He clearly doesn't give a rat's ass.\n\nThe best description I have for this place is: CONFUSED.  \n\n- We are high end and we will charge $29 per burger but we will have casual picnic tables for you party.\n\n- We will operate in a Smith's Grocery Strip Mall in a suburban neighborhood full of families but we will remain dimly lit and without a family-friendly atmosphere.\n\nI will never return to Poshburger.  There are way too many good burger options in Vegas.  \n\nI really wish Gordon Ramsay could walk into this restaurant and give his 2-cents.  He would drop F-Bombs left and right because the owner is clearly blind to their actual clientele.  And if Gordon Ramsay saw the overcooked \"medium rare\" Kobe burger that I was delivered, he would throw it in the owner's face and say \"Aw c'mon you wanker, how can a fucking Michelin-Star chef burn a good piece of meat like this.  Especially when there are only 10 other customers in the restaurant!!!!\"\n\nGood luck to anybody else who dares to waste their money at Poshburger,", "type": "review", "business_id": "viVNUK88__6GAlov3cx13g"}

A total find in Las Vegas.  \n\nDon't judge it by its location or easy and simple atmosphere... There's a few select items that pack an amazing punch with every bite that will blow its competitors out of the water. \n\nLoved the Tree of Life Pita - Even if you're not Vegan or Vegetarian, its a must try.  This is my personal favorite and go to.  The flavors are excellent together.\n\nThai Salad - Wonderful and yummy with great flavor\n\nThe Complicated order - If I feel like being bad, this is it.  Packed with loads of bacon (that I think are done in the oven because its not greasy) and turkey.  I couldn't put it down, but I was stuffed afterwards.\n\nThe other sandwiches were good, but the Tree of Life and Complicated order my favorites. \n\nSides - some were better than others, but not because they were bad but they weren't as exciting as the sandwiches.  With flavors this good, you have a lot to live up to with each bite.  And they were great about letting us sample them. \n\nThey also have a slow drip cold coffee device right by the register that looks fun... I don't drink coffee, but I was told it takes 8 hours to brew.\n\nI love the service.  Even though its a simple cafe, they are great.  Super friendly and attentive.  A definite must try!  And the best part is they deliver.  \n\nSo, if you're stuck eating the nasty food at the convention center for a conference.

If you are liking noodles, and needing a fix of real Ramen, this is truly a great place! I have had Ramen in Japan, China, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, and I must say that I really enjoy the Ramen at Monta Chaya.\n\nService - 5 Star - The staff here are consistent, friendly, kind and very much professional. They are busy, but treat you like family, help manage your expectations as it is a busy, small and crowded restaurant.  I have been here about 5-6 times now and it is very consistent.\n\nAmbiance - 5 Star - Small, open kitchen, enough room for perhaps 22 people on tables and then perhaps 8-10 at the bar.  Typical small Ramen place but the perfect blend of size and coziness.  Ramen when I learn to eat it in Japan is all about waiting to sit down, ordering your food, eating and slurping while hot, drink all the soup, and then wipe your brow, thank everyone and leave so the next person can sit and enjoy. No socializing here!\n\nFood - 5 Star - Rather than discuss their Tonkatsu Ramen, Shoyu Ramen, Miso Ramen, I am just going to talk about the two things that count the most:  The noodles and the broth.\n\na. Noodles - Perfectly timed cooking on the noodles. They have truly perfected the temperature and the al dente texture of the noodles. I say this is perfect because you barely notice the noodle. It is both delicate and substantial at the same time.\n\nb.  Broth - The noodles do not interfere with the broth which is amazing. Lightly flavored, but full of taste. Nothing is overbearing, it is simply just ichiban. What enjoy about the broth is that it is well balanced. Not one ingredient is overpowering the flavor and to achieve this delicate balance is awesome!\n\nc.  Other stuff - 5 star - They have cold noodles, extras bits and toppings, extra noodles and of course really great appetizers.  The kaarage and the gyoza are really fantastic.\n\n\nI have to say, besides the great ramen, I really enjoy the staff here. They make you feel welcome and part of the family and that makes me want to keep coming back and bringing more people!\n\nGK says, check it out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VO-OXdvcTHnhKhkNjjJDeQ"}

Town.\n\nEveryone has their own opinion on ramen, but for me, Monta hits the spot. The first time I ever had ramen was at the one on Spring Mountain. And I was soooo happy they opened one on eastern which is closer to my house! Both places always never let me down. The staff is courteous and never miss a hello or goodbye. Though wait times can be ridiculous, it just shows you how good of a place they really are. The gyoza is really delicious. The dumpling meat is cooked and tastes good with the sauce they give you. Today we tried the steamed buns and it was TO DIE FOR. The sauce that was marinated on the pork was a hint of spicy and I don't know what it was but it was soooo good. I wanna put it on all my meat! Lol. It only comes with two, but I split it with four people. We each didn't want our portions to end. I could probably eat two of them and be full. We also tried the calamari which was crispy and marinated in a sauce so you didn't need to dip it into anything. Not amazing but not bad either. As for the ramen, I usually get tonkatsu shoyu. Their broth is tasty and the pork is cooked perfectly. I actually like eating the fattier parts, which is very yummy. I like to add egg, butter, and corn, but you can have it anyway you like. The little spice stuff they have on the table is a good little kick to add! And you can control how spicy you want the broth. I like to add sesame seeds for texture. The noodles are cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too hard. I don't like mushrooms so I ask for none and they're always very accommodating. The food comes out hot and pretty fast as well. They play newest music and sometimes they even play old hit songs which is a lot of fun cause it makes the atmosphere really fun.

But I gotta give the local guys a shot and I'm glad I did.\n\nOrdered the shrimp tacos, added beer battered fries for the table and snagged the free drink check-in offer. Didn't have to wait long for our tacos and was pleasantly surprised to find that they don't pre-build the tacos for you. After they cook up your fish and put it in a fresh corn tortilla, you get to put the rest of it together using the nearby bar. This is a HUGE plus for me because far too often I've had fish tacos elsewhere that were drenched with some nasty mayo based cream sauce that I can't stomach. Here though, I was able to load my shrimps up with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, some bomb salsa, and cilantro. WORD OF WARNING: They are not exaggerating about their heat levels. When they say hot, they mean hot. I went with the hottest salsa and got a good burn going, despite how used to spicy food I am. So choose with caution. One of the staff members was kind enough to give a couple of recommendations on what to put on the tacos as well which I'm glad I listened to them because I would have missed out on the cilantro sauce.\n\nThe end result? Freakin' excellent! Very fresh fish and fantastic toppings. Found out after I'd inhaled my first taco that all the sauces are made in house daily which explains why it tastes freakin amazing and fresh. The beer battered fries were also great. I recommend sharing them though because you get quite a bit.\n\nOverall, a great dining experience and great customer service. My only gripe is that they close a bit earlier than other taco restaurants which makes it difficult for me to eat there for dinner given my work hours. Otherwise I'm glad I gave them a try.

I am definitely a fan! Now, don't let the name of the restaurant cause you to miss it because the entrance really is at the Side Door! \n\nLet's start with our waiter, Aaron. He greeted us and brought water in a timely fashion. That is always a plus when you are part of a large group like we were. We were a group of about 10. Now, our of our group arrived before we did so their food came out  a lot sooner. This was cool because this allowed us to browse the menu a little longer and review the list of extensive beers that they have. OMG! I almost felt like I was at the Firkin Fest because there was such a variety of beers from different breweries. \n\nSo since I am a beer fan and enjoy trying new beers, I asked Aaron for some recommendations based on my preference of Wheat Style Beers. He recommended Mosquito Beach by Lake Louie (sp?).  It was delicious! It had a very unique taste. Let me try to describe it. It was very smooth (and not bitter), but at the end had a mild hoppy flavor, but it was very crisp in that that hoppy flavor did not last long on your tongue. Now, that's the best that I can do, but it is definitely worth a try. \n\nOkay, now the food. Our group probably ordered everything on the menu and let's just say, we were not disappointed by anything we ate. Each dish was served pipping hot, had unique flavors, and was delicious in every way. So, we could not resist sharing our food with everyone in our group. I am going to try and remember what foods we tried: Side Door Burger (which came with Brew City Beer Battered Fries), Fish Tacos, Mac n Cheese, Tater Tots, Beer and Cheeseburger Soup. And I almost forgot that we tried the beer, Mob Craft Batshit Crazy. It was an English Brown Ale brewed with milk sugar to add a balanced creamy sweetness, and flavored with a delicious blend of Nicaraguan and Ugandan Coffees from Just Coffee Co-op that exhibit slight characteristics of cherry, tobacco, and brown sugar. Now that was the description from the restaurant and I cannot describe it, but it was delicious. It was not your ordinary brown ale. \n\nAfter dinner, I had the opportunity to chat with Aaron for a few minutes. He informed me that this restaurant used to be the Cabana Room and has only been open for about 18 months. Did you know that the recipe for the Fish Tacos was an original recipe from the Cabana Room? Now, that's cool especially for those that miss the Cabana Room. Now they have something to entice them to try out this place! \n\nAs a side note, Aaron also recommended that we try out the Lemon Drop Martini at the Comedy Club on State Street. Sounds like Aaron knows a little something about beers and spirits! Oh and I almost forgot to mention the most important thing, all of the beers on tap are just $4/glass!

We turned the corner down the long walkway to the entrance and it becomes cuter and cuter. As we enter, the inside has an authentic type feel and is surprisingly really awesome! The decor has a theme and the place is pretty hopping.\n\nSo we order drinks, the house margarita and a prickly pear margarita (when in the southwest, do as the tourists do).

It's far from bad, but it's not great in my book either.  Some notes :\n\nNigiri was hit and miss.  Some (like the sake) tasted fresh.  The Unagi was not cooked very much, so it was missing the slightly crispy edges I love.  The Ahi was SAD.  It was probably the pinkest colored ahi I've ever had, and the fish was FALLING APART.  They probably gave us the worst cut of the fish, one that most others would have THROWN out.\n\nThe Calamari was great though!  Light breading with salt/pepper seasoning.  I think this was the highlight of the meal...we ordered a second round! \n\nHamachi Kama. Very good, flavorful collar! It's a very SMALL one though, but at least it's done well!  Yum :)\n\nSoft Shell Crab Hand Roll. Very good, and I love the presentation on their hand rolls!  Tasty :)\n\n\"Pain in the Ass\" was probably my favorite roll : Deep Fried Salmon, Tuna, Avocado and Cream Cheese. Heavy, but good overall, with a nice kick from the wasabi mayo.\n\nAnd to finish, I ordered the Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream. I didn't think it was bad, but Cathy really disliked it.

They were doughy and mush.\nI hate to write this, because I did expect better, but for now I will stick with a few other Italian restaurants that are much better, and maybe give them another shot after a few more months in business.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Oa2dOUzRic8Hvgdh3EAFuw"}

Didn't think much of it until the aroma of sizzling beef, onions, and french fries took a hold of my nose and started pulling me towards it just like in the cartoons.\n\nFirst of all, the place itself is really tiny, but my nose and my stomach did not care at that moment. The fact that it was part of a gas station didn't bother me either. \n\nAfter seeing the menu, it's not hard to decide what to get. You can order a basic burger for about 5 bucks which comes with a quarter pound patty, lettuce, tomato, onions (grilled, regular or both), pickles, and your choice of either mayo or spicy chipotle mayo. For an extra charge you each you can add a fried egg, bacon, cheese, or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.\n\nFor 2.25 you can get a basket of fries which are big enough for 2 people. Just so you know these fries are fresh cut with the skin on and it goes straight to the fryer. You receive it sprinkled with a special kind of salt seasoning which kind of reminds me of the seasoning they use at Red Robin on their steak fries. Once you start eating them, you will know right away that it was a whole potato just minutes ago.\n\nWhat I ended up getting was the #1 combo which was just your basic burger with both kinds of onions and the spicy chipotle mayo. It comes with fries and a drink which I paid a total of 7.88 with tax. Now some places, like Five Guys or Fat Burger, you are looking at about 10 bucks easy. If you are just gonna get the burger with fries, you might as well get the combo because its about the same price but the only difference is you get a drink so that's a good deal.\n\nHonestly, I can probably eat two of those burgers just to fill me up but the fries themselves helped take care of that. I could only eat half of it and ended up taking it with me in the car. Ironically, when I was at a stoplight going towards my next destination, there was a homeless man on the corner holding up a hungry sign. So I gave him the fries. I guarantee you he was more than happy to accept it. It was a win-win for both of us.\n\nBesides their namesake, they also have other items there like Philly Cheesesteaks, Hotwings, Chicken Sandwiches, and Onion Rings. Did I mention their ranch sauce is like liquid crack? Once you taste it, you just might start twitching due to withdrawals from not having it since you will be coming more often to this place. Im not really a ranch person so im not worried about it. *right shoulder starts twitching. \n\nHours are Sunday through Thursday 11 am to 10 pm. Friday through Saturday 11 am to 11 pm. They take cards and I don't remember if there was a minimum or an extra charge for convenience.\n\nSo overall, Burger Brothers will be a normal rotation in my lunch schedule any time im in the area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OlKX_FAE38BjfKsyjLQF5A"}

What a wonderful concept! Brought to Las Vegas from Zappos.com and the Downtown Project.\n\nThe drinks are inexpensive and they offer gluten free and organic bottled beers. The bar area is the only place in which underage patrons aren't permitted. Such a great place for those teetering between the 20-21 years of age.

We had a unique dinner because we were able to experience both the inside and outside seating.

The beer and food was also mediocre. The only redeeming quality was the waitress who was efficient in serving our large group by herself.

I was a bit irritated that the bruschetta on the menu did not state that it had seafood in it, as one of my friends is severely allergic to seafood. Good thing I tried it before he did, and immediately tasted the crab meat. I suggest they change the menu and put stars next to their seafood products as an indicator, because it only says \"cream cheese, avocado, and onion\" as the toppings. It was still quite delicious, but my friend was the one who ordered it and couldn't even enjoy it or try it.\n\nAs our main course selections I ordered the spicy seafood pasta. It was the perfect amount of spice and the seafood tasted fresh! And I'm usually very picky with how I like my seafood. Two of my friends both ordered the bacon and mushroom pasta, which I tasted. It was also delicious. My other friend had the clam linguini, which he thought was delicious as well, although I didn't try any. \n\nOverall, I gave 4 stars because the atmosphere and food was really good. I enjoyed it and would come back again. The only reason I docked 1 star was because of the lack of labeling of which appetizers have seafood.

Tavern in the Wall is the type of business that Aspinwall needs -- casual bar/restaurant where you can grab a brew and a bite, watch your Steelers/Pens/Pirates/whoever games, and generally just have a good time. \n\nI enjoy Tavern in the Wall as a bar.  They have some great drink specials, friendly staff, and free live entertainment on many weekends.  The owner also seems like a nice guy.  As a restaurant, however, it's sorely lacking.  The food, I hate to say, definitely resonates as your typical blah, not-horrible-but-not-great bar food.  That would be completely fine with me if Tavern in the Wall acted like a bar serving bar food.  But their food is priced like they believe they are a legit dining destination -- seriously, $10 for a fried zucchini appetizer? For reference, the high-end Joseph Tambellini restaurant across the bridge in Highland Park charges $9 for fried zucchini. $17 for pasta with sauce? Again, just to put that in perspective, Girasole in Shadyside charges $13. Based on the \"bar quality\" of The Tavern's food, their prices definitely need to come down to Earth and be more in line with the type of food they serve....either that, or they need to up their game quality-wise and change their bar vibe to more of a nice restaurant vibe to justify the price.  \n\nSo, in sum, if you're looking for a good local watering hole where you can catch a drink, definitely give Tavern in the Wall a try...but if all you're in the market for is a great dinner, I'd look elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8xvnIG6zg2cA-thJJ5NW8A"}

However, we were pleasantly surprised.  \n\nWe decided to go on a Saturday at lunchtime (around 12:30ish), so we figured it might be busy.  It wasn't completely full, but it's a big place and most of the tables were occupied.  The numerous TV's had college games on, which we love, so that was enjoyable.  We were seated, and our waitress came right over for our drink order.  As soon as our drinks were brought over, we ordered an appetizer (potato skins), and told her to give us a few minutes to decide on our entrees.  She came back a few minutes later, and we ordered...no problem with service, in our eyes.\n\nThe potato skins were really good.  They gave us 2 nice scoops of sour cream (hubby always complains that most places never give you enough to put on the skins).  They weren't greasy, and were cut in inch wide strips, as opposed to scooped out.  I found them easier to eat this way.  Not too much cheese, a nice amount of bacon, love the chives added on and they were crispy.  (A busboy came over after we finished, and asked if he could take our plate.)\n\nA few minutes later, our main courses arrived.  My husband got the pulled pork sandwich.  In the picture it showed cole slaw on it, but it was actually on the side.  So, he piled it onto the pork.  I got the American Soldier burger--no cheese-- with a side of onion rings.  I also asked for a bit of BBQ sauce for my burger, which was quickly brought over.  While I was setting up my burger, putting the red onions, tomatoes, mustard and BBQ sauce on it, my husband downed his sandwich.  I think he liked it!  My burger was cooked perfectly, nice and charred on the outside, but juicy inside.  The only issue I had was the bun being a little too big.  But, that's a personal taste thing, and my husband loved the bun.  The onion rings were crispy, and I used the extra BBQ sauce to dip them in.  My husbands fries looked pretty good, and he seemed to enjoy them.\n\nOverall, the food was pretty good, and the service was nice.  There were lots of waitresses around, but they all seemed to be helping tables and not standing around chatting.  So, maybe someone is reading the reviews and made some changes.\n\nAlso, as a side note, the bathrooms are big and clean (at least they were on a Saturday afternoon).  I'm sure on a Friday or Saturday night, the place is loud and hopping.  But, that's not for us, so we wouldn't be going at those times anyway.  Maybe some of the bad reviews were down to growing pains, and hopefully, they've matured enough that more good reviews will be coming.", "type": "review", "business_id": "66jI6z-JuLasvd692ymycg"}

Service was SLLLLOOOWWW.  It feels as if though they are short on servers.\n\nWhen he finally came back to ask for our order, of course I order uni, amaebi, then he stop me and said, \"We ran out of uni and amaebi. Let me go check.\"  Then he disappeared for a while.  When he came back, he handed us a sheet to order from and verified that they do not have uni and amaebi to order.\n\nSo I ordered items on the special menu (toro steak, salmon belly, white fish), saba, superwhite, salmon, scallops, salmon kama.  Server came back to let us know that they are out of salmon kama, how about Hamachi kama.  We said yeah that's cool.  He left and returned to let us know that they are also out of hamachi kama.\n\nFor the items that we did order, the only thing that tasted good was the salmon belly and toro steak.  Other items were doused with too much sesame oil, tasteless, or downright odd (the scallops tasted like they were previously cooked).\n\nSo at this point, I had given up on order anything else since I do not want to stuff myself with mediocre sushi.  Earl however, is eating for sustenance.  \n\nWe never, ever, order sushi rolls at AYCE.  But this night, Earl did.  He eat, just to eat.  We overheard another table said that they couldn't order chicken fried rice because they are out of it.  How they heck do you run out of chicken fried rice when your restaurant isn't even that busy?  We learned from another yelper that visited Sakana earlier that a health inspector came by earlier and service slowed down a lot.\n\nGuess that explains some parts to the evening, but what about mediocre sushi?\n\nConclusion:  Goyemon is still the best.

But we were in search of something quick before our movie date. Because Kaba Curry just opened their new location, we figured we give it a try. They are located in the same shopping center as the original SF Supermarket. Their exact location is the 2nd floor next to Bazic and hidden behind the staircase.  No official large signage anywhere yet. \n\nThey have a temporary menu right now which consists of putting together your own curry plate. We went for the staple of Curry & Rice ($4.99) and added one side - Spam Katsu ($1), which is 1 slice.  You can choose your spice level as well. \n\nOur dish didn't take too long and we woofed it down. We were probably in and out within 15 minutes. There was one party of 2 there before us and a couple of singles that arrived after.\n\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised with the curry. It had a deep flavor and had the Husband and I rethinking Japanese curry.\n\nSides range from Ground Beef to Deep Fried Tofu to Tonkatsu from $1 to $3.\n\nToppings range from Corn to Spinach to Cooked Egg from 50 cents to 75 cents.\n\nI guess most people choose a few sides and toppings to round out their dish.  Good to know for future reference.\n\nFree topping with Yelp check-in! (They just started this a day or two after we went!)\n\nSide note: When we paid with our credit card on the Ipad, we didn't see a spot to add a tip to our total.

Can't say enough about the staff though, the whole crew at the counter was really nice and friendly. \n\nI like spicy food so the Caliente was calling my name. For starters, the chili is friggin delicious! It's ridiculously greasy but it is tasty and I'd go back just for chili cheese fries. The burger patties are super thin and when I tried to taste the meat by itself, all I could taste was the toppings. On the Caliente, it only comes with one patty so I felt like I was eating a chili sandwich with onions and peppers. They do have really good buns though so that's a plus. \n\nMaybe my mistake was not getting a double or maybe even a triple burger. It may sound like a lot but the patties are so thin and I just couldn't taste the meat at all. They have a couple things on the menu I'd really like to try, especially the tamale and their breakfast.

Street parking only - look out for the resident-only parking zones!\n\nThe place: Loved the simple but modern decor, with its large windows that offer up perfect lighting. What can I say, you notice light when you're into photography! The restaurant isn't huge by any means, but they do make good use of the floor space. That said, you'll need reservations if you want a table, and you'll want to book well in advance. I was unsuccessful in getting reservations when I tried to book 1-2 weeks ahead of time (twice) so.... you've been warned. \n\nThe food: OK - I think my expectations were set excessively high due to the reviews, and as such, I felt a little disappointed. Don't panic - this isn't a crappy review. My date and I started with the buratta and tomato, which was both fresh and delicious. It's not very heavy either, so is the perfect starter because it won't fill you up before you receive your main. We decided to share the appetizer and from my perspective, it was perfect for two people. Now, if you're a 200-pound male, you might want to get your own appetizer. \n\nMy main was pasta with lobster. Do I remember the name of the pasta? Nope, but it's very similar to Strozzapreti, which is a short, thick noodle that has a bit of a twist. The pasta was al dente and perfectly cooked. Personally, I felt that there was enough lobster in my plate, BUT others may not feel the same for the price point. The lobster was fresh but I found it to be somewhat chewy. In terms of overall flavor, it pains me to say that the dish was underwhelming. I was expecting the dish to burst with flavor but sadly, it did not. Flavor was almost non-existent. My date on the other hand, really enjoyed the Casarecce so maybe I just ordered the wrong dish or the chef was having an off-night. \n\nI ended with the Tiramisu, which was delicious. Perfect balance of coffee and cream - I would have bought several jars of these to bring home, had they been for sale =-D\n\nService: Great. Our waiter was friendly, took the time to explain the menu, made suggestions on what to eat and drink, and patiently waited while we decided on what to order. \n\nPrice point: A little painful. Considering the size of the portions (small), and also taking into consideration the quality of the food (great), I feel that the menu is a little overpriced. For a glass of wine, appetizer, main and dessert, it cost me $73 (excluding tip). At this price point, I would perhaps expect complimentary Prosecco or something.\n\nVerdict: I enjoyed my overall experience so I'll give these guys a redo.", "type": "review", "business_id": "v_6CD6s41aBPvygTJRK5ew"}

Kind of frustrating that they would post the deal and not even be open, but it did say at the bottom of the yelp listing it was \"coming soon\" so I will take the blame. Their Facebook page said they would be opening the following month, but that never happened. I reached out to Caf\u00e9 Casera by e-mail to see if they had any updates on when they would be opening. The owner responded promptly and said they were working out some last minute things and should be open soon and they would let me know when they opened. The owners word was kept, I received a e-mail letting me know they were opening and ready for customers. It took me a couple weeks after receiving the e-mail to make my way over, but with as long as I waited already what was a couple more weeks? \n\nWalking in hubby and I were greeted and given menus right away. originally, we planned to eat inside the restaurant, but the fountain machine wasn't set up yet and they only had cans of soda ($1) and bottled water ($1.25) so we decided to order our food to-go and get drinks from a gas station. What a bummer because they had Cherry Coke! I spoke with one of the owners, Julie who said they were waiting for the \"Coke man\" to come hook it up. I had a wonderful conversation with Julie who also introduced me to her husband and mother-in-law. I could tell while talking to Julie, just how genuinely passionate her and her family are about the food they are serving. She told me how they are there at 5 am each morning making everything from scratch including the corn and flour tortillas that are all personally made by her mother-in-law. \n\nSome of the menu items here will be something you have seen before at other restaurants, but I promise you Caf\u00e9 Casera puts there own twist on each dish and I personally haven't ever tasted anything like it. I have never heard of \"Sizzle\" which is the specialty here, so I obviously had to try it! \n\nSizzle Tacos ($7.95) - Seasoned ground pork and beef, onions, cabbage and cheese sauce inside 2 crunchy taco shells. The taco shells tasted amazing! They had such a fresh flavor and weren't greasy at all. The stuff inside the shell is an acquired taste for sure. I thought it was alright, but can't say I would order it again. Hubby took a bite and thought it was the best thing out of everything we ordered and he ended up switching me his Bean & Cheese Burrito for it. The burrito was so good! The flour tortillas here aren't your average flour tortilla, they are a bit thicker. The beans and rice were great. The beans are thick and the rice has a nice flavor, nothing dry or mushy about it.\n\nCheese Quesadilla ($2.25) - The menu says it is grilled with Colby cheese inside, but honestly it tasted more like Velveeta cheese. The cheese was very pasty. The tortilla was kind of burnt on the outside too. After two bites I was done, I just didn't like it. \n\nSopaipilla ($2.75) - Yes! This was great. I have had different versions, but not one like this before. They put cinnamon and powdered sugar on it and it can easily be shared. It does have a sweet flavor, so if sweet things aren't your style you can try one plain. I enjoyed the sweet flavor and would order it again. \n\nAs I sat there waiting for my food to be prepared, I noticed the menu boasted that the dishes were prepared with a \"New Mexico Flair\" so if you want green chile they can add it for 75 cents. It confused me because if the dish is prepared with New Mexico Flair, wouldn't it already have the green stuff in it? Julie was kind enough, because I forgot to order the chile on my tacos, to give me 2 free sides of it. This was awesome green stuff indeed! Hubby was just eating it with a fork, cold and all. I do wish the chile came warm and was already included with the food, since the food is prepared when you order it, a customer could just say they don't want it on there. Oh well they were gooooood!\n\nThe inside was very clean and the decor was nice. There are about 4 tables inside if you don't want to take your food to-go. Caf\u00e9 Casera also offers breakfast burritos on their menu. Purchase a yelp deal and give this family run business a try! \n\nMon - Sat .... 7 am until 10 pm\nSunday - Closed", "type": "review", "business_id": "Y353UfUlI4zk-XIQXiOzcQ"}

I think there's a lot of potential, but there are a few things to iron out.\n\nWe really like supporting mom & pop type restaurants and have been to Albuquerque on many occasions, so we're very familiar with New Mexican cuisine.\n\nWe started off with chips & salsa, which had good flavor, but was a bit on the mild side for us. $3.25 for chips & salsa is a bit on the steep side as well considering the vast majority of restaurants offer them complimentary.\n\nWe had the CC Sizzle sopapilla which was a little disappointing. The sopapilla was very dense and a lot more like Navajo fry bread than a light, fluffy and airy pillow of love that we've come to expect from a good sopapilla. Also, I was expecting a stuffed sopapilla, rather than it being folded taco style, with very little meat.\n\nThe CC Sizzle meat was quite good and we really liked the flavors. However, for $8 I think it was really lacking in the quantity department and was pretty skinny for my liking. Look at my pictures, there is a little bit of meat below all that cabbage. We had them add Hatch green chiles, add $1, and would've liked a few more of those as well. The rice & beans were pretty standard fair.\n\nWorth going to?

Another server unwittingly begins to clean the wait station with said towel. Once finished the server places said towel near the silverware tubs. Moments later the server proceeds to polish all of the silverware with said towel. All this took place while the owner was completely oblivious and engrossed in whatever was occurring on his smartphone at the time.

The appetizers and service were good. The dessert menu was very underwhelming. So far a 3 start review.

The first thing that hits you is the noise as it is a very popular place for the 20/30's crowed.  Also young families have a spot on the patio for the kids. I was having a slight misgiving until I tried their food and hand crafted beer.  I was blown away.\n\nMy date and I have the wings (French confit style) and the Green Chile Pork sliders. First, the wings were out of this world. We generally get the dry rub and the kitchen did not disappoint. The meat just falls of the bone and has tremendous flavor. Next we tried the sliders and also were very impressed. Soft pretzel bun with very well cooked pull pork with just enough green chile to make it interesting.\n\nNow the beer.  BTW - no other alcohol is served. Just their beer. My date had the Superstition Coffee Stout which was extremely smooth and not too filling. I had the double Pale which was amber in color and full of flavor.\n\nWe will be back, especially when my son visits from Atlanta.  He is a big beer aficionado and will enjoy this place immensely. The food just blew me away and we will also remember to get there early so we can sit outside.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7Q19H5nM3oFRyCg_j0QV1A"}

This is one of those reviews.\n\nI don't often make it up to Tivoli Village but on the trips I did I would always peek in the windows and see how things were going at Echo & Rig. Tonight I finally got into the place and it was great.\n\nWhen we entered they walked us through the lower level, we got to check out the butcher shop, the deli/charcuterie counter, and the bar before heading upstairs to the dining room.\n\nThe layout is a little random with the bar/butcher shop downstairs, and the dining room & kitchen upstairs. The dining room is very open and there's some room between the tables. There is a patio off the dining room and an exhibition kitchen along the entire south wall of the dining room.\n\nThe servers were attentive, the hosts were friendly, the bussers were quick to refill the water glasses (complimentary sparkling or still water), and bringing the proper weapons(utensils) to make sure we could properly enjoy our meals.\n\nThe food was really, really damn good. We had several things off of their expansive (Over 90 item) Menu. The hardest part of the entire meal was selecting which items on the menu to try and which to keep for another visit.\n\nThe meal started with a bread basket, it was a pretty basic looking basket with 3 slices of bread and no butter, at first I thought it was odd, but after trying the bread I realized butter wasn't needed.\n\nNext up was our small plate \"appetizers\". First up was the Thick Cut Bacon and BBQ Sauce. The Bacon was grilled which added a great flavor, the BBQ sauce was ok, but I mainly ate the bacon plain and it was good. We also had the Bone Marrow Carne Asada, yes you read that right it's not only \"Gods Butter\" Bone Marrow it also comes with carne asada as well a perfect combo on the toast.\n\nAfter that was the Charcuterie Plate, Prosciutto, 3 different Salamis, Pate, and Head Cheese all were delish, but the Prosciutto was my favorite.  Next was Grilled Octopus, now I myself am not an octopus guy, but this dish was amazing and made me rethink my hatred for octopus. We also had the Mushroom soup, it was creamy and delish.\n\nNext was the Entree Course, I had the Butcher's Cut Ribeye which was a 14oz steak cooked medium rare (possibly a touch over), served with Garlic Chips and Mushroom Rockefeller. This would have been enough on it's own, but not for us. We also added Portobello Fries, Mashed Potatoes, and Heirloom Carrots for bonus eats. The Potatoes and Carrots were amazing, but the Steak was the stand out item of the meal. I'm not a fan of steak sauces, but if you are, unlike most places that charge $5-7 for a sauce, Echo & Rig includes one free sauce with your steak, which is a nice touch.\n\nAs if all this food wasn't enough the waiter told us about the dessert menu. They  only serve Ice Cream Sundaes. And after hearing him say \"salted caramel ice cream\" I was getting the turtle sundae. It was the perfect end to an amazing meal.\n\nI can't wait to get back and try the rest of their menu. I really am looking forward to their late night menu for a late bite before heading to La Casa down the road for the a Cigar.\n\nAlso the have free wifi for all your food porn posting needs which is a great added bonus", "type": "review", "business_id": "GGyHZtnAA5LBgouB-32ARA"}

Very Victorian. It harkens back to the supper clubs of the olden days. I half expect to find gentlemen in top hats when I entered the door. Instead I only found a few mid-day drinkers playing video poker.  Being a sports bar, of course there are wide-screens all over the shop, which seem a bit anachronistic given that the place is swathed in late 19th-century red velvet drapery.\n\nInterestingly, the owners have placed a few old-fashioned items on the menu, such as baked brie, which are juxtaposed with more modern tasters, such as the deep-fried mashed potato bites. The menu is fairly enticing.  Sadly the food falls short. It feels like everything here is made to sound impressive, but, looks and tastes like it was cooked at Wendy's. I would have assumed it was all fresh-made, but it all tastes to me like it originated in the freezer.\n\nToday, I tried the Chicken Florentine Soup. It definitely came from a can.  No doubt about it. Then I got a California Turkey Burger.  The lettuce was limp, the avocado was almost non-existent, and the turkey patty was too salty.  However, there was a nice char on the patty, and I do love grill marks.\n\nMy main complaint is that this swanky restaurant has tremendous potential and no one here seems to know how to reach it.  The menu was promising. The descriptions of each item got me salivating.  Unfortunately, my dining experience turned out to be like a bad blind date:  your friend tells you how great this hamburger is, and then you finally meet it... and it is nothing compared to the burger you tasted in your dreams.\n\nMy advice to Elixir: if you're going to do gourmet pub food, actually do gourmet pub food.  It's just not right to titillate a person's tongue without bringing the taste buds to climax; wink, wink.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_BrLcaVzE6GqBilwmdQOfg"}

Not exaggerating)\n\nThere was nothing spectacular about any part of my lunch at all.  \n\nService was terrible.  Walked in, waited at the front, not sure if I was supposed to seat myself.  Waited for anyone to even make eye contact but all the staff seemed too busy to even notice. Finally walked up to one of the servers and she sat me at the bar.  Took a while for a server to come take my order.  Once I ordered it.  Took a while to get my food.  They dropped off my food and not a single server stopped by to see how I was doing.  No One!  \n\nI ate everything, because I was starving.  Was up for 5 hours running errands and didn't have anything to eat.  Everything was below average.  Fish did not seem fresh to me. Salad and cucumber was tasteless, miso soup tasted  like all soy sauce based.  The steam rice was good. But I wish I had ordered the Chicken Katsu lunch instead.  Was still hungry, but  I can't eat just steam rice plain.   Why would you serve a bowl of steam rice with sushi anyways?\n\nTo sum it up...this place is FAR from 5 stars.  It's lacking in every department.  Oh and I their credit card machine was down so the server told me that she had to write down my credit card number and enter it later.  Geez. \n\nThere isn't any reason I could think of to bring me back here.\n\nGoyemon is and has always been my favorite.  I just wanted to see what all this 5 star rating hype was all about.

Truly a space where the concept of quality ingredients and time honored techniques yield a superior product it was with two golden, creamy arancini that the meal began and then progressing through pizza both red and white, simple and complex it was perhaps most telling that the best slices of the day belonged to the Margherita DOC with a the Buffala Mozz briny funk finding harmony in the hand crushed tomatoes yet not to be outdone the eponymous Settebello also shined as the novel pine nuts and mushrooms added an earthen undertone to the pairing of cured meats.  Truly a place where not a single savory was anything less than excellent it was without hesitation that desserts were selected and again choosing broadly the rewards were myriad; a creamy budino on par with DOCG's for best in town a clear favorite amongst many while the Bella Mela proved just as well conceptualized as the pizzas though ever more subtle - a characteristic ignored by both the Calzone and Zeppole; the first harkening a campfire's smoke and the second soft and supple but both filled to bursting chocolate decadence and all the better for it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "I6DMTSrI2Vlp7Ai-Z9tUXw"}

You could have asked this before you went to get the food so you could have grabbed everything at once making my wait less but yes I do. Hot damn! Apparently those toppings are in short supply because I was given two packets of peppers and 1 ramekin of cheese that was so empty I could count the flakes. $39 bucks and I can't even have half a ramekin?\n\nOkay, well the front of house sucked but how about those delicious pies I've been reading about?\n\nI got home with our pizzas and salad and without saying a word to my wife she took a bite and said, \"these aren't cooked all the way.\" Sure weren't. I knew this because I had to sneak a piece on the way home (to test things out as any good husband would do) and had the luxury of eating cheese that wasn't quite melted. \n\nOn to the \"bread\" salad.

Pretty unique layout. Waiters bring the food up from a kitchen located downstairs? The bathrooms were also unconventional. Go check it out!\n\nFOOD:\nFor appetizers, I shared the pig candy and Brussels sprouts with my friends. My main entree, I got the Dirty pasta (with ground duck).\n\nI couldn't help but think of one word when dining here: \"salty\". I'm not sure if Butcher and the Rye tends to be a bit more heavy handed with the salt, or if it was this one occurrence. But the Brussels sprouts and Dirty Pasta definitely were more than a bit salty to me. \n\nBrussels sprouts were large enough in quantity to share with a large group. My one friend described it best, \"Kind of tastes like the Cool Ranch Doritos\". The taste was so empowering that I honestly could not taste the Brussels sprouts at all, which is unfortunate.\n\nPig Candy was pretty decent. A small plate for one, it was tasty, but nothing to write home about. I sometimes judge how much I like a plate by evaluating my willingness to part with it and order something else the next time I come back. Let's just say, I'd probably give another appetizer a chance.  \n\nDirty Pasta was unique; first time I ever had \"ground\" duck. The noodles were thick and chewy with bits of ground duck sprinkled into the pasta. The sauce was good, but again, a bit salty, so I did not enjoy it as much as I could have. Out of what we ordered, my friends liked this dish most. \n\nSERVICE:\nNeed to reserve in advance! This place gets booked fast especially for dinners on Friday and Saturdays. Very polite wait staff and professional.\n\nIMPRESSIONS:\nI wish I could say I would highly recommend this place, after hearing the hype surrounding this restaurant. Unfortunately I don't think I can at this time. I don't think my friends were that blown away either.

I opted for the savory french toast, which had a parmesan-herb batter and a sunny-side up egg. It was a welcome change from the usual french toast. Other menu items that I found intriguing (and will definitely encourage me to go back and try) were the chilaquiles, farmer's hash, shrimp and grits, and the lox box.\n\nAnd I must mention the highlight of breakfast: the oatmeal creme brulee. If a dessert and a breakfast cereal knocked boots, this would be the beautiful product of their love. Creamy custard with a crackly skating rink of sugar atop steel-cut toothsome oatmeal, served with fresh berries. We were all fighting over every last spoonful.\n\nService is energetic, even at what's considered the ungodly early hour (at least in a college town) of 9 a.m. Coffee is refilled promptly, and great recommendations were made on food and drinks.\n\nDespite its name, Bassett Street serves more than just brunch.

Arcadia/Biltmore seems to have an influx of burger places lately, and I was really hoping for something different as we already have so many burger options. However, I decided to give this place a shot last Friday night. I'm not sure if it's because it's around the holiday season, but we had no problem with parking, there were several spaces available. We were given a menu on arrival and sat down at the counter. Like other reviewers had stated, this is a modern take on a burger stand. \n\nThe menu is very limited, but the choices all sounded great. There's even healthy options; kale salad and an ahi sandwich. My husband decided on the cheeseburger, and I chose the post-it note salad which is their special (written out on a post-it) that changes daily. We also ordered the shattered potato chips, and two Black Market Hefeweizens.\n\nService was very fast and attentive, it was fun to see the chefs cook and prepare our food. My post-it note salad was similar to a Caesar made with butter lettuce, sliced pears, and walnuts. It was very good, you could tell the dressing was homemade, and it was full of flavor. My husband was very happy with his burger, it was cooked to the requested temp, nice and juicy with a good bun. The shattered chips were worth coming here alone! It's a whole sliced up potato which is fried, with a greek yogurt dipping sauce that was to die for! We couldn't stop eating them. While we were enjoying our meal, we were given samples of their Sangria which was fantastic, I regretted ordering a beer instead.\n\nSo I was very nicely surprised by Ingo's, it not your typical burger restaurant.

They offer everything from bonfires, beanbag toss, ping pong, to full indoor and outdoor seating. \n\nThe atmosphere and ambiance enhance the overall dining experience with breathtaking views of four peaks and lower fountain hills. The Friday night bagpipe player who comes up the 18th green of the golf course is an experience all in itself that is a must see. \n\nGreat food, great service, great spot!", "type": "review", "business_id": "FrjW5L9CNstkFyK9TcDZRQ"}

This is definitely not what I experienced at the Sun Prairie location last night. \nIt was two hours til closing, so I'm not really sure why all four employees looked at me like i had just wrecked their evening by entering the store. There was one couple in there already eating and other than that, it was empty. I filled out my bag for a hummus sandwich and took it to the front. The girl who rang it up glared at me when I said hi to her. She gave me my total before I could even ask for chips and a drink, and seemed exasperated when I did so anyway. Well, I'm paid and getting my drink and waiting for four employees to make my sandwich - the only order in the restaurant. Folks, this took almost 20 minutes. For some hummus and veggies to be spread on some bread. 20 freaking minutes. I took it home and opened it to eat as I'm starving now. Not one single veggie. I had nearly every vegetable on my bag marked, and all I got was hummus on bread. No cheese. No dressings or sauces. No veggies. NOTHING. Four rude employees. 20 minutes waiting in an empty shop. Nothing on my sandwich. This place is awful and I will never return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QHSoLHA09QR8gVWc7DUTug"}

The guacamole was bland and chips slightly greasy. I was not impressed with the corn tortillas because they were store bought and cold. Carne asada meat was tough and flavor was average.

Beans tasted freshly made and were piping hot. \n\nThe service was also slow because there was one waitress taking orders, bringing out the food, and busing tables. \n\nI don't see any need to go back to Desnudo because the tortillas are not home made and the restaurant felt unclean.", "type": "review", "business_id": "I_h0uin_oo0WNqFy3qKEpw"}

It is literally right up the street from me. And for what you pay, you get a decent amount. I have gotten a two meat plate combo which runs $14.00 before tax. For this choice, you can choice two meats from either brisket, ribs, chicken, sausage. You also get two sides and can choose from potato salad, pinto beans, baked beans, mac and cheese, cole slaw, or rice.\n\nI actually enjoyed their ribs. I am no BBQ connoisseur but I like what I like. The first time they were definitely more tender than the second time i ate there. And the second time the seasoning tasted different. Like they put ole bay seasoning on it, which I am not opposed to, just kind of took me a minute to adjust my expectations.\n\nThe brisket was alright the first time. It wasn't overwhelmed with the flavor of smoke and you could see the smoke ring and was pretty tender. The second time, it was just off for me. Definitely not tender and just off. I don't have a specific reason.\n\nThe sides here for me are a major fail. The baked beans are straight out of can. The cole slaw was bland. The potato salad is essentially potatoes and mayo only. The mac and cheese was cheesy but too soft and bland. \n\nThey offer you BBQ sauce on the side (which is good, nothing great) and onions and pickles. I agree with another yelper and it would be nice if they gave you bread on the side. \n\nWould I come back is the question. And the answer is yes. I guess I am a glutton for punishment. I really believe they have a good starting base and can be much better.\n\nThey have changed their hours and are now open from 5:30am - 5pm close.

With use of such high quality ingredients I know something spectacular could have taken place. Maybe it's because their new, maybe I am just not a fan. Either way, this spot did not impress. \nI was so excited to first go to Container Park, and second, try new food. Of course one of my first choices would be the Kerry Simon place. Plus the BBQ joint was out of ribs and brisket! This seemed like the place to go. My boyfriend and I each ordered the Boss hog. A sausage on a fresh roll with their house made spicy mustard and grilled red peppers. Not really what the description read, however that's what we received. Also ordered Kerry's famous sliders, chili, and mac and cheese. \nFirst complaint, not that it's small (hello name container park) but the fact that when sitting outdoors, we didn't have the option of the cool tray with a pickled relish, spicy ketchup, and Dijon mustard. And when I asked for a tray, the lady was confused and said \"well what would you like I'll get you a side\" I should have said everything on the tray, however I simply got mustard and sat down. In the cold, outside, without a working heater. As I watched every other place have a heater on, P&B, did not. \nSecond complaint, we clearly said we were sharing an order of sliders, and somehow we received 2 orders. (I was wondering why our bill was so much) \nI was hoping these sliders would be over the top amazing. Nope. Good quality beef, a fresh tomato, and TINY piece of bacon that didn't even reach every bite, and some onion jam that was bland. Disappointment all around other than the actual quality of meat. In the sandwich and the sliders, I could tell the meat was decent. \nThe chili was probably the best thing we had. If you like meat and not beans, this ones for you. However it needed a dollop of sour cream and some onions! Maybe even crackers?! Not just cheese.  \nThe mac and cheese was super average. The flavor would have been OKAY, had it not been over spiced with fresh herbs. I don't think a hint of mint goes well in mac and cheese personally. \nWe were sitting there saying \"we should have gotten tacos, look at those heaters working.\" \nIf I hear about a turnaround, or them \"working out the kinks\" maybe I'd return. But honestly, it isn't likely.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uft0J3Wd5JkDOcuqjoNghA"}

It is located not too far from the south end of the strip so location and accessibility was not a problem. Upon entering my first impression was that the place seemed pretty inviting. It was spacious with the buffet nicely spread out along the far end, tables nicely spaced apart so after having eaten in Mount Everest the previous day this was a welcome change.\n\nThe buffet again has all the standard items that you will find in an Indian buffet. Appetizers included tandoori chicken, vegetable pakodas (vegetable fritters) and samosa (puff pastry with potato filling). Entrees included butter chicken, goat curry, saag, rice, biryani and noodles. Desert included gajar ka halwa (carrot pudding) and kheer (sweetened rice pudding with milk). Taste wise what stood out to me was that everything was good but not great. Well the biryani and naan (provided fresh on the table) were both excellent but all the entrees were enjoyable but nothing popped out. The deserts could have been better. The gajar ka halwa cried out for some more mava (heavy cream) and the kheer for more sugar. Obviously they were made keeping the health conscience, not too sweet regulars in mind (another resturant which was full of locals). \n\nService was good, all our plates were cleared promptly and price wise it was $10.99 which is pretty much standard for Indian buffets.\n\nOverall I feel that the food surely needs a shot in the arm, but considering the overall package of location, decor, service and value for money a repeat visit is surely on the cards during our next visit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ureGF96EaoIKmE8SmEpVQA"}

And after my extreme excitement about the opening, I'm extra disappointed!  My husband went to pick up food, ordered everything correctly, exactly as he and I wanted it, gladly waited 10 min for the food, drove home and realized there were many things missing...  That ended up being just the beginning of our trouble!  I had the receipt in hand and called asking to speak to a manager. The lady who answered the phone, Carla, said she was the manager, so I told her that we didn't receive items we had paid for, to which she told me she would be glad to give me the items if we came in to get them right then and there. However we live far from the location and my husband was not going to drive all the way back out there. She then told me that was all she could do, that it was company policy there were no other options. I asked if she could take my name and leave a credit of some sort in the office or behind the register, anything other than us driving back out there or just eating the money. To which she said, \"no\".  That is when I got upset. As a Chicagoan who had been waiting for this restaurant to open, I was beyond disappointed to be treated like this!  She told me there was no proof the burger was missing other than for us to bring all our food, (that we had already unwrapped,) back to the restaurant. So I said, \"isn't there an extra burger laying around?\"  She instantly replied, \"no.\"  I then asked for her full name and the phone number to corporate because I was so upset that my husband wasn't going to be able to eat and that as new, potentially loyal customers, we were being treated in this manner.  She then asked me to tell her my ticket number again and read to her word for word what was on my receipt. In other words she assumed I was lying trying to get something for free and needed me to recite the list word for word in order to verify I was telling the truth...  All over a $6 burger!!  Here's a tip, you are a new restaurant in town, make your customers happy even if it means losing $6 down the road rather than arguing back and forth with them for 7 minutes while the food they DO have is getting cold!!  After I did the required song and dance Carla put me on hold and came back telling me she magically discovered there WAS an extra burger at the grill, verifying that when I proposed the idea to her 5 minutes prior she had answered without actually checking!!  At that point she asked for my name and phone number and told me that there would be a note behind the register under my name to give me all the items, in addition to the burger, that were missing for free on my next visit. After all that nonsense I could finally get down to eating the food I had been waiting months for!  The bread on both the hot dogs in our order was stale. Other than that, the hot dogs themselves had a nice snap, the fries were good, probably would have been upgraded to great with the cheese I ordered and paid for and the beef was ok... I will be back to receive our missing items for sure...  As for after that is TBD. Sad first experience!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PzQJMdqmvGftgFwitgU2oQ"}

The sliders buns were pretty hard and we didn't even eat them. The one decent thing was the buffalo wings. From what I recall they don't call it buffalo, but it was pretty much buffalo sauce. The girl was nice but wait times were heavy. It's nice inside but just another normal place. Not too crazy about it, probably wouldn't go unless it was somewhere someone really wanted to go.\n\nThese girls gotta learn how to smile and look friendly, not snotty and stuck up.

All I have to say is that the wait was definitely worth it, the food was divine, as in I wanted to keep on eating, but I was just too full, ( why can't I have two stomachs !?! ) their portion sizes are big here, so you can share the main courses with your significant other and get a snack or appetizer and try something new along with your main meal. I would definitely come back here as they have a meat substitute section on the menu- so to all of my vegetarian friends out there, you too can have your very own soy chicken wings, should you so choose, I did not have them, but will be giving them a try when I come back.

I took a bite and realized it was more medium than medium-well.  I didn't complain because the burger was actually pretty good.  Complimenting my burger was a ton of sweet potato fries that were just okay.  I also got to taste my gf's Shrimp & Lobster Mac.  I could tell just by looking at the Mac that it was lacking a little taste.  In my opinion, their Shrimp & Lobster Mac can use a little more shrimp, lobster, cheese, and mac.  \n\nOverall, I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of the Blind Pig.  Ambiance is cool, their burger is pretty good, the service can be better, and the shrimp & lobster mac can use some work.

Each time I said it was time to write a yelp review but once I got home, I  tried to overlook the poor, unfriendly service that I received.  Today is the day I write a review. \n\nLet me start by saying, I always go through the drive thru.  95% of the time, the service has been less than friendly and many times, I felt that I was putting the employee out by even using the drive thru.  I have waited as long as 22 minutes in the drive thru (4 cars ahead of me) only to be greeted at the window with, \"$16.34.\"  No, \"Sorry for the long wait\".......No  \"Thank you for your patience\".....nothing!   On NUMEROUS occasions ,  the bag was handed to me ....\"here you go\" and the window was shut on my face.  I found I was the only saying, \"Thank you.\"  I've come to the conclusion, they place their most unfriendly and rude employees at the drive thru window.   I don't take it out on the employee because obviously, they have not been trained properly in customer service. \n\nToday, around 11:30 AM, my son went to Kneaders to pick up lunch.  I have posted a picture of how they packed the bag  ---1 full sized sandwich, an order of french toast and an order of bread pudding.  They were not placed in 2 bags or flat in the bag but they crammed all of it in one bag,  on their SIDES!   The inside of the sandwich slide out of the bread and was loose in the plastic container.  The bread pudding and french toast...well, you can imagine how those looked.  THIS is what prompted me to finally write a review. \n\nI watched this location  being built and on the first day it opened, I went through the drive thru and spoke to a trainer who was here from Utah.  I told him how much I was looking forward to the restaurant opening and that Ahwatukee needed a place like Kneaders.\n\n Ahwatukee is a small community within a large city.  Word of mouth goes a long way in this area.  Management needs to start reading the yelp reviews, respond and make changes accordingly.  My next trip to Kneaders will be to return my loyalty card.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dlPAHjvW-CtmC5ym0qjJ_g"}

Don't judge me.\n\nAfter escaping the near 100-degrees that makes up an Arizona April day, we were promptly sat down in an intimate booth.  The atmosphere was very simplistic and classy.  We were given a menu for Korean and a sushi list on the side.  After observing an impressive selection, we ordered tako su, soft shell crab, and two stone rice bowls [fresh water eel and caviar].  Had I known my lunch date wanted a stone bowl, I would've chosen something else so we can try more items.  Don't you hate it when that happens?\n\nThe tako su appetizer consisted of five piece of steamed octopus tentacles dressed in lots of Japanese vinegar.  It was a pretty toothsome little piece of octopus and wasn't anything spectacular. I don't really recommend it.\n\nSoft shell crab appetizer was pretty standard.  It's not exactly San Francisco where they fry the whole blue crab with legs and all.  I'm sure the legs were used for spider rolls so you really just get the body of the crab.  Once again, nothing spectacular and wouldn't order it again.\n\nThe hot stone rice bowls though, that's love.  They actually serve it in the stone rice bowls!  A lot of places around the valley gets away with serving their rice bowls in metal bowls but this place has your rice, veggies, goodies, and egg on the stone bowl.  It was sizzling and crackling for a long while.  This thing is hot!  For $16, I would come back for the rice bowl alone.  Note:  the advertised caviar was really just smelt roe they use in sushi.  \n\nOverall I had a great and filling lunch.  Service was fast and friendly, food was decent, and I will totally be back to try their actual lunches.  Our total bill was $52.

I would have called it even if the food was at least good.... But it wasn't. The sliders were served on hard bread and tasted bland. The fries were ok, but nothing to balance out their epically terrible service. All of this was beyond disappointing because I had heard such good things from friends.

With that being said, there are many people who swear by these things, so please give it a try. Based on the sweet people here alone, it's worth a trip. In the meantime maybe they will tweak the oil, or something. I wish this place all the best!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rY8lpy1hOn9cejD-CXoebw"}

I love being able to customize flavors and mix and match so this is really the type of place for me. The doughnuts are more of a cake style with different glazes and powder/sprinkle toppings. They have multiple pre-fix options, as well as an option to create your own flavor combinations on the order sheet.\n\nSome of the favorites from our group meeting were, chocolate covered cherry, morning buzz (mocha flavored with chocolate topping) and french toast. The customer service was also great and the gentleman on the phone helped me place a phone order after looking over the menu online. I liked the experience so much I went back for another dozen for my fiance's work meeting that same day. They also have a frequent buyer program, when you buy (I think 8 dozen) you get a dozen for free.\n\nOverall great experience.

Look on yelp for pictures of the menu and learn what the Spanish words mean. With so many cow parts, pig parts to choose from, you really won't know which to get (or order one of each).

It was a very plain presentation, with a circular sandwich bread accompanied by a simple mixed greens salad. The sandwich was decent. The bread (Whole wheat low carb), was soft, but similar in texture to the ends of your sliced sandwich bread you find in the grocery store. The chicken had a light, crisp, breading on it and the taste of the chicken itself was very \"clean\" (i.e., not processed or overly seasoned). Unfortunately, there was a little bit of gristle/cartilage/fat left on the end of my chicken piece. The salad itself was just slightly over-dressed, and while I liked the vinaigrette, it felt like I was eating more dressing than salad when I took each bite.\n\nAt the drink station, the iced teas when we went were blackberry/black tea, watermelon/black tea, peach/green tea, and jasmine strawberry/green tea. I tried all but the jasmine strawberry, and my favorite was the light, refreshing taste of the watermelon tea.

Somehow until today long lines combined with my tight schedule have kept me away from this place (and all of its other locations).\n\nI think everyone knows what to expect at a Burgatory at this point - big burgers and behemoth milkshakes. I'd tasted their milkshakes before when I'd stopped in for a drink and to split some appetizers with friends after a movie (at the time I hadn't been nearly hungry enough to order a full burger, though). But when I opened the menu today a milkshake that hadn't been there last time caught my eye: burnt almond torte. And yes, it's made with Prantl's torte cake - plus Vanilla Vodka and Amaretto. Needless to say, I HAD to order this. I have one word for it: DIVINE. I mean the Nutella & Nestl\u00e9 Crunch Bars is a close second on the delicious scale, but it's hard to beat milkshake made out of Prantl's burnt almond torte. It's a shame I wasn't able to finish this amazing thing...\n\nI wish I could say my burger was as awesome as that milkshake; I ordered a custom creation beef burger topped with some of my favorite ingredients - cheese, aioli, avocado, etc. It certainly wasn't bad, but after all the hype surrounding Burgatory I expected an incredible burger to come out of their kitchen. Unfortunately the meat patty was kind of dry and as a result didn't melt in my mouth like I expect from a reeeeeeally good burger. Honestly the ingredients were kind of my main course's saving grave, as they added the flavor and juiciness and texture I needed to enjoy everything.\n\nSo, will I return to Burgatory in the future? Yes - the milkshakes are amazing, the appetizers I've had previously were just fine, and I'm willing to explore the menu to see if another main course impresses me more. But will this place ever be my go-to burger place? I really doubt it. There are many other delicious burger locations in the city now where I can satisfy a burger craving without waiting forever to get a seat. It doesn't help that instead of offering smaller drinks and sandwiches alongside their main staples, Burgatory only has a menu that can only be defined as \"go big or go home.\" As a result I left today feeling like I wasted good money on a meal I couldn't really finish (I ate the burger, shared my fries with friends, and had to leave a decent portion of milkshake behind - I'd already eaten past the point of being comfortably full by then). Not a good feeling, and one that I can easily avoid by eating elsewhere and saving Burgatory for truly special occasions - and for more gluttonous days.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jmquanz2qdn_IEgxmn0wsQ"}

Important to know there are two menus - the Americanized Chinese menu, and the Chinese Chinese menu. We've never ordered from the American Chinese menu - if you want authentic flavors, ask for the Chinese menu, which does have English descriptions. I'm vegetarian, so I can't speak for most of the food (which I heard from my dining companions were excellent), but even non-vegetarians enjoyed the Buddhist Style rolls, which are vegetable-stuffed rolls made from tofu skin and fried.

The food is just too good.  Why four?  My wife and I had a reservation for 8:45 this past Saturday for our 11th anniversary.  We arrived early, at about 8:20.  We ended up waiting until 9:25 to be seated.  No huge deal, but the female front of house manager came up to us at about 9:10 and said she would comp our first round of drinks.  It never happened.  It also took us about 15 minutes to get our first drinks once seated.  I get it, it's new and it was Saturday night.  \n\nAs for the food?  Crazy.  Crazy good.  it made me forget about the rough start immediately.  We had four courses, each as good as the other.  We started with an Salami dish that came with pickled cherries, apricot, and two kinds of mustard.  Sounds odd, but you roll them all up into one bite and you understand why they make it.  I was shocked how well they balanced each other out.  \n\nSecond we had chicken marsala meatballs with roasted wild mushrooms.  I thought I knew what marsala was supposed to taste like...nope.  This was far better than any meatball and sauce I have ever had.  How did they make chicken meatballs taste that good???\n\nThird we had pasta (bucatini calabrian chili pomodoro & fresh ricotta) .  It was just as good, and now I understand why fresh pasta is key.  This dish will finally get me to break down and buy the pasta attachment for my kitchenaid mixer.  \n\nThe main course we decided on was the whole roasted chicken for two, cacciatore style.  First off, they bring the chicken in a large bowl to you from the kitchen, uncut for your inspection.  They take it back at that point and cut it for you.  This gives you time to wipe the drool up.  The flavor was amazing, and had a smoked paprika rub.  The cacciatore sauce was perfect.  \n\nOn the side we had crispy polenta with checca sauce.  I have never had polenta, so I did not know what to expect.  I was expecting something close to grits, but this was so much more.  The texture was like silk, and the flavor was mild and tasty.  \n\nThis meal was worth the wait and the price.", "type": "review", "business_id": "s5-VDvUqyYnD8RG3LPqnbQ"}

The atmosphere of the restaraunt is cozy and welcoming, with comfortable couches around the walls. I was greeted by Jason, who kindly helped me make my empanada selection. I ended up choosing the Bulgogi Empanada, which Jason reccomended I try with the Hoissin BBQ Sauce. The empanada had a soft and chewey outside and had great flavor and tender bulgogi meat on the inside. The Hoissin BBQ sauce is a must, and complements the flavor of the empanada perfectly. Not only did Jason bring me napkins and ask how I liked my food, but also brought me an Atomic Coffee to try that he had told me about. The Atomic Coffee is an iced coffee that they cold brew for 14 hourswith different infusions and spices. It was definitely the best iced coffee I've ever tasted, and will blow anything you can get at Starbucks out of the water. I also had a Nutella Oreo empanada that Jason prepared for me. I'll let the name of the dessert speak for it's self. Most dessert empanadas are always hit or miss, and this one is definitely a hit. \nAfter I was finished with my Empanadas and started typing this review, an employee here named Matt asked me if I wanted to try something new and I said sure! He then came out of the kitchen with two plastic cups and put lemonade into each one. He mixed one with\nCardamine and the other with Cinnamon and Nutmeg. He told me that he'd been experimenting with these on his own and that they weren't on the menu. Both were exotic tasting and the Cinnamon and Nutmeg one had a great kick to it. I was very impressed, Matt made a lemonade that was originally great even better. I would definitely like to see his lemonade's on the menu one day. He and Zach then talked to me about Arizona and welcomed me to the valley. \nThe only thing that was better than the delicious empanadas and drinks was the friendly employee's and the amazing customer service. \nI've definitely found my new hang out spot and will be coming back a frequently!", "type": "review", "business_id": "mX67n1UXYtKrU9HlX7gYiA"}

The bar area in the back is actually very nice and seems like it could open to their outdoor patio when the weather is good. It's kind of a wood cabin feel and although it's kitschy it's not really my thing. Both times I've visited they've asked if a high-top table in the bar area would be OK, despite having many open booths and regular tables. Why are you holding out on me if the place isn't packed? How about the real deal seating? \n\nService has been pretty decent, albeit a bit slow at times. The drinks haven't gone empty at any point, which is definitely a plus. My husband and I have been ordering from the lighter portion menu. He gets the 8 oz filet and I've tried the chicken breast meal. For the price, these are solid, filling, and not horribly unhealthy options. They both come with red potatoes and a veggie. My steamed broccoli was ice cold when it arrived, although I couldn't complain about the chicken. The waitress was quick to bring me a new side of broccoli. We also order the side tossed salad, which hasn't actually been tossed with dressing either time we've ordered it. OK, so I like my salads tossed. There. I said it. \n\nThere are plenty of televisions and, from what I understand, they show the UFC fights for free, which is a big deal to some.

Such a unique and wonderful addition to an already amazing menu. Taquitos, queso fundido and shrimp tacos are the tasty dishes I tried. If I wasn't as full as I was I wouldn't have stopped there. How could I forget table side guacamole! I'm dying to go back and try this shrimp with cilantro cream sauce dish that made my mouth water. They use all non-GMO products and hormone free meat which I so appreciate since my new obsession with food documentaries on netflix. Their menu is delightful for offering such healthy options.

Highlights of our visit were actually the vegetarian and vegetable dishes- would love to see him open a place specializing in that cuisine!\n\nCRISPY CHICKEN SKINS: Not a fan, sorry. Ate two and was done. The salty-fatty-savory-sweet thing just doesn't do it for me. BF inhaled the dish though, and I will admit that it was better than expected. Just not for me.\n\nDEVIL'S EGGS: Deviled eggs plus black caviar plus crispy pancetta? The only downside to this is the sodium, but the flavors are quite good. A bit pricey at $2 per egg half but, hello, caviar. Would get this every visit.\n\nSHORT RIB SLIDERS: Perhaps the least favorite dish of the night. The meat was dry but the root beer glaze flavor was very unique. Tater tots were perfectly crisp and reminiscent of Sonic's but with a slight dusting of seasoning (not enough to call spicy) but felt with all the effort put into the other elements of the dish, the ketchup could have been spiced or at least not cold-straight-from-the-bottle-Heinz. It went untouched. \n\nRAINBOW CAULIFLOWER with garlic and lemon: So help me God this will be a part of my last meal on earth. So much texture and color and flavor, this dish was the star of the night! I cannot rave enough about it, it's a must-order.\n\nROASTED YOUNG BEETS: with pistachio, orange, and goat cheese was the runner-up for favorite dish of the night. Lately every place has a beet dish with citrus and creamy cheese elements, but that doesn't mean this one isn't superb. Shared this with my guy the way other couples might share a dessert. Que romantico, eh? \n\nWILD MUSHROOM FLATBREAD: with caramelized onions and bleu cheese, because the guys across the table from us got it and I wasn't quite in a cheese-coma yet. Very crisp with slight char and great mix of flavors. Can't go wrong with this, simple but well executed.\n\nBOURBON FUDGE BROWNIE: with brown butter bacon ice cream. Holy crap. The brownie wasn't quite what I was expecting and probably had four thousand calories and seventeen cups of sugar in it, but it was good and chewy and was well-accompanied by the ice cream. I preferred the ice cream by far and the mix of flavors and textures was novel. Regardless, I was done after three bites because it was just. too. much. Even BF didn't finish and he's a total glutton. Consider yourself warned.\n\nD\u00e9cor was eclectic and I loved the mix of metal and wood materials, industrial feel with quality fixtures. Community tables are a thing here, pretend you're in SF and ignore the couple next to you and get over it or just belly up to the bar.\n\nSuper service from server, busser, and everyone else- great mood evident among staff, all came across as genuine and personable.

We sat at the high tables outside because the music is not as loud as when you are sitting on the little couches/tables. \nOur waitress came to say hi pretty fast and ask us if we were there before and give us some time to decide.

We had to let her know that we were ordering drinks too. She took the notepad out again and wrote down our drink order... put the notepad away and went to take our menus. We had to stop her and let her know we were gonna order entrees when we made a choice. I know everybody here in yelp doesn't wait tables but I've done this too long so it's kinda hard to overlook at details like that (I never leave a table without trying to upsale drinks and apps/salads).\nWe get our drinks... my drink came without a straw... I know it's not a big deal but I really don't like drinking from restaurant glassware without one. Good thing was is that when I came in I had an almost empty drink from the casino so I used those straws. My boyfriend order a Mexican beer... She didn't bother to bring a cold glass or even asked if he wanted one... oh and no lime either... it's a Mexican beer come on! So we had to stop her to get a glass and a lime.\nBefore we order I had a question about an item... How it came out... I'm pretty sure she didn't know the answer because her reply was... \"yeah I'm pretty sure\". Good thing it wasn't anything related to an allergy cause I could be dead lol. \nI don't know, maybe she was having an off nite or something. I had good service there before, not exceptional but plain good.\nWe asked for a box and she brought the check right away... Not asking about desserts or coffee or another drink or anything. We gave her our industry card so she had to take the check back to get it discounted. After that she forgot to bring us the check back so after 7-10 minutes we had to flag her down for it... And then we had to flag her one more time to actually pay.\nOur original check was almost $100... kinda expensive, and I would expect better service considering price and location.

I knew the food would be solid, and I was right, it did not disappoint.\n\nThis time, I went to sit at the bar. I can't remember the bartenders name, but he was awesome and we chatted about the World Series since he was a KC fan. Ordered the Tres Viejos drink, basically a totally jacked up shaken margarita. The premium tequila mixed with the house made citrus juices and honey definitely tingled my taste buds, in a good way. The spiced salt that was rimmed on the glass was just the cherry on top. If you are a big fan of cocktails, you should check this place out!\n\nI wanted to check out some food here. I ordered the mango guacamole. I remembered at the previous event, we were given a pineapple guacamole that was outstanding! I thought the mango version would be equally as good. After trying it, I thought that the guac was OK. It didn't have the same \"pow!\" as the pineapple version. The flavor of the mango was lost in the avocado. It felt like the guac was pre-made a considerable amount of time ago. It had oxidized. The chips served with the guac were really good. They were super crispy, and they didn't have much grease on them.\n\nThis time, I ordered a torta, but not just any torta, but a carne version! At the event, they had these carne tacos that were phenomenal. I decided to try their torta version. The dish was also served with French fries. Let me tell y'all about them fries. This may be a Mexican restaurant, but Mercadito probably makes some of the best fries I've ever had. The size is perfect, not shoestring and not steak fries, but a size right in the middle. They were super crispy on the outside and meltingly soft and airy in the middle. This guy right here, he was impressed!\n\nThe torta was extremely good as well. The carne was just like how I remembered it, but it was cut a little bit thicker due to it being a sandwich, which I liked. The meat was seasoned well and cooked to a medium rare center. The slaw filling was creamy and crunchy and full of vegetables and herbs that were very fresh. I loved the torta bread that was used, it was fluffy and buttery. I really enjoyed that they griddle both sides of the bread to give it a nice crunch! A splendid dish.\n\nThe service here is on point. I sat at the bar, and the bartender did a really great job making sure that I was well taken care of. Everyone working there seemed really friendly. \n\nI live quite a distance away so coming here on a regular basis is not really a feasible option for me. But if I did, I would be here all the time. This is a great spot for upscale Mexican cuisine and a superb drink program. They have a great happy hour here as well.

Later on, I saw one of my friends bookmark this place. Looking at the reviews, I was kind of surprised no elites had checked out this spot. Might as well take one for the team!\n\nOn the Yelp map, this location is pretty hard to find. Here is an easier way, just park in front of the I-Naba restaurant. It's right in front of that building. I thought they had been building up this spot for a long time.\n\nUpon entering, it's a very well taken care of resto. It could be due to the fact that everything is brand new. There is plenty of seating, and it fits the bill of a pho restaurant. After ordering, the food came out in a reasonable time.\n\n#7 - Pho Dac Biet (combination everything pho) - I thought that the broth was ok. It had a light beef flavor, while I prefer a more robust one, but it was good. They gave a lot of noodles, and they were properly prepared. The bean sprouts/Thai basil/jalape\u00f1o peppers were very fresh, and they gave a ton of bean sprouts. The meat was one of my favorite parts. The brisket was so good and had a real \"beefy\" flavor. The rare beef and meatball were very fresh and tasty as well. One criticism about this dish would be that I wish there was more meat. I thought they gave a fair amount of brisket, but they could have used a couple slices more of their rare beef, another meatball, more tripe, and more than just 1 tendon. Especially when After the yelp discount the total came out to 8.70, Yikes!!\n\nThe service was pretty good as well. The servers came around to make sure I had enough water at all times, and they even brought me some extra napkins without having me ask.\n\nEven though I think it's a little bit more pricey than other pho joints, I thought the quality was pretty good. I still have my favorite spot, but this might be a possible replacement if my spot burns down or something. I wish they would give a little bit more of their fantastic meat, but ::shrugs::", "type": "review", "business_id": "wmm19sGdCiL5IZhViYQY2Q"}

I'm glad there's nothing that really changed though except for the name. As I've written in my Feast Review that I could no longer find, the best time to go is when they serve whatever food you like.  There's seafood night which I'm not too concerned about since I'm allergic to shellfish, and then, there's Lechon Tuesday!\n\nMy buddy, Lawrence M was excited when I told him they have lechon. So, off we went!  We weren't sure what time they close so, we felt bad when we got there 3 minutes before they close.  We had a plan B in mind and were ready to march to a different place to eat but they allowed starving gym rats like us to go ahead and stuff our faces.  It really pays to be polite and kind! The hostesses, our server and foo station attendants were nice eventhough we got there so late. So yeah, they close at 9pm.\n\nDinner for us was only about $12 with military discount on Veterans Day.  Normally, it's about $12/person and you get a discount with a player's card. That's really cheap! I'll say this again, lechon can be expensive because not a lot of places have it. You have to be in-the-know where to get lechon and normally, you have to pre-order it and buy the whole pig for abput $200 depending on the size of the pig. Anthony Bourdain dubs this succulent pig with crispy skin THE BEST PIG he's ever had. So, even if you paid full price for the buffet, you definitely get your money's worth. Get this, they even have Mang Tomas lechon sauce.\n\nThey have the typical buffet fare such as prime rib, turkey, BBQ ribs, salads, pizza, pasta, potatoes, veggies, Chinese food, Mexican food, pies, cakes, cookies, ice cream, etc. Since we got there so late, the soft serve was liquid - but I didn't care, I just want the taste. The lady behind the counter kept telling me that it's liquid. But I like ice cream soup. The only thing was the coffee ice cream had ice particles. The other flavor I got was fine. The lady behind the ice cream and pie counter was sweet and funny.\n\nItems on my plates:\nLechon - absolutely great! Skin was crispy - finding crispy skin requires great skill. 5/5\n\nChicken Fajitas - a bit dry. 2/5\n\nSteamed BBQ Pork Buns - most buffet places that serve these are awful - too doughy, too dry. These were quite good for a buffet place. 4/5\n\nSesame Balls - they're tinier than the ones you'll find at Chinese restaurants but this isn't a Chinese restaurant. These have red bean inside. 4/5\n\nFried Plantains - I love fried bananas! Some bananas were soft, some were firmer. I pefer the softer ones as they tend to be sweeter. 4/5\n\nMeatballs - these were pretty good. Either that or I was just very hungry after working out. They're not dry and they're quite tasty. 3.5/5\n\nPrime Rib - juicy, medium-rare slice of beef. Mmmmm...3.5/5\n\nTurkey - I was expecting a very dry piece of turkey because it's closing time and it probably has been sitting under a heating lamp forever. I was pleasantly surprised that it was juicy. 4/5\n\nFrench Fries - I was so happy to see they have fries. I love fries! Warm, crispy fried potaoes. Add a little bit of salt and I'm happy. 4/5\n\nKielbasa - I've been good at avoiding cured meats lately but Lawrence gave me his sausage. Since it was already on my plate, I had to try it. Maybe, I'm not used to salt anymore but it was pretty salty. 3/5", "type": "review", "business_id": "rL_-lD63VOITLPeJIWo-kA"}

Training staff and getting the products right for which they have aways to go.\n\nI've spent a significant amount of time in the south having had excellent to fair Mexican food. I believe in doing the foods heritage right or not at all.\n\nRats I lost the only two pictures of my three hardshell taco order. I don't think it was the apps fault rather mine for not rebooting the SGN2 for several weeks.\n\nThe ambiance: not Mexican, nor a first date eatery unless she has a great sence of humour, very forgiving, madly in love with you or any combination thus stated. Females and wimpy men beware, it is well airconditioed, which apparently only I do appreciate.  \n\nFood order: three hardshell taco, fish, spicy* pork and chicken. *spicy for white people who want to feel ethnic. Fish, one small piece but tasty. The chicken and pork portions were more generous.\n\nToppings: the tomatoes, lettuce and cilantro were fresh. The guacamole Is just mashed a vacation maybe with some mayo, it was underwhelming in being part of a (fish) taco. As a side dish it would have better value. By the time the Toppings are into the shells the paper lined basket looks like a major size salad.\n\nThe problem: I noticed when the server was building each taco. That the meats with exception to the fish had too much moisture. The tomatoe and corn were dripping wet and the hardshells are very thin. By the time I started into the third taco, just picking it up I knew it was finished and one bite later it fell completely apart. The Toppings were fridge cold while biting into a warm bottom. Admittedly I've never experienced this sensation before in any real Mexican eatery. I now had a salad bowl with a soggy broken taco shell, oh joy oh bliss, not.\n\nThe manager: I politely commaned the owners presence to discuss the above. To his credit he offered a discount, then to replace the taco, and I suggested he replace the shell and I'll scoop the amassed mixture back into the new shell. He was visably pleased with the solution. He admitted that the hardshells are too thin and the supplier is looking to rectify the problem. He on the other hand was surprised about the too much moisture content being the biggest contributor to the problem. Really test, test, test and verify is not just a neat saying common to the military, engineering or computer industry and yes the food industry.\n\nConclusion: returning to the task-at-hand I'd been given a deformed taco but plodded ahead anyway.  There was more than enough taco meat and salad to make two. With fork in hand I cowed down like Jethro Bodine over his gargantuan bowl of cereal.\nI left feeling very full, with a very mild buzz on my lips and the wonderful taste of fresh cilantro upon the tongue. Hopefully the owner, btw a very nice guy, learns and fixes things quickly. Creating and cooking from fresh real cantina mexican would elevate a much needed catagory and create a loyal following I'm sure.\n\nCost: 3 hardshell tacos fish, spicy pork and chicken without extras or drinks, $10.34 taxes included. Billed as three fish tacos.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aSu9nSZ7EmK6laG0tvGYhA"}

Their pho, amazing. End of story. Sometimes when you get pho, it can be bland. Their's was full of flavor and came with a good amount of fixings and was perfectly portioned. I also got their eggrolls, again, fantastic. I wish I got a little bit more mint and another leaf of lettuce, but that's my fault for not even asking. I also got their Thai tea with boba. I LOVE the fact that sell boba. I checked out the rest of their menu and I am very excited to try their sandwiches. The man I was sitting at the bar with (oh, yes, they also have a stocked bar. Thumbs up for that!) informed me that their shrimp and pork spring rolls are to die for. So now, I need to go back and try that out.\n\nThe atmosphere is very nice and clean. Big screen TV at the bar for the lonely patron like myself. The staff were very friendly. I can see that they're under staffed so please keep that in consideration when enjoying their food. \n\nThis is the first time I have been there and definitely will not be my last. I even plan on bringing my coworkers there for our next lunch meeting in February. \n\nYou guys are fantastic. Keep it up and I will definitely be seeing you soon!\n\nEDIT: I had to come in and add to my review after reading everyone else's. \n\nFirst off, I agree the prices are slightly higher than say Saigon over in north Chandler or the hole in the wall places throughout the valley; you have to remember what their expenses are. The commercial rent in south Chandler isn't exactly the cheapest in the world. Especially in a hot area like Germann/Queen Creek Rd and Gilbert. So of course you're going to fork out a little more money than say a restaurant in west Mesa. \n\nThey're a new restaurant, they informed me they have only been open for 4 months. They're still trying to get the flow of everything. I was on my lunch break also, so I wasn't exactly there on my own time. I got my food and drinks and FINISHED EVERYTHING within 30 minutes. That's as quick as it is at Saigon. \n\nSo for you guys reading the negative reviews on this place, I definitely did not experience any of that while I was there. I actually had a very good time chatting it up with another patron that was sitting at the bar with me. He said he has been going there since day 1 and he absolutely loves it (we also talked about other Vietnamese places throughout the East Valley and this place is on par with them.) \n\nAgain, I highly recommend giving this place a shot. Make sure to have an open mind when going in that they're new to the game and that this place has a ton of potential. I see them rising to the ranks of Saigon and Chandler Pho.\n\nKeep it up AZ Pho and Grill.", "type": "review", "business_id": "g4lTsPZiSM4VqrhJiaNkRA"}

So, let's see what's really going on.  \n\nI had a co-worker rave about this place years ago and at the time; they were just based on the East Coast.  Well, now they're here and I was curious if my bud knew what he was talking about. Their menu consists of wraps, soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, protein shakes, and smoothies.  Also on their menu are the total calories for each dish.  \n\nI had two meals.\n\nMeal #1:  Premium Burger, Baked Potato, and an extra Chicken Breast.  There was nothing really special about the baked potato.  It was on the small side.  I thought that the burger was as juicy and as tasty as it gets for a 90% lean burger.  The highlight was the chicken breast. I eat a lot of chicken throughout the week.  In my opinion, Muscle Maker's was one of the best clean chicken breast that I've had in a while.  The meat was thick, plump, and grilled just right. \n\nMeal #2:  Rocky Balboa Wrap.  I only got this because one of the regulars and the employees suggested it.  I'm glad they did.  This wrap had chicken breast, turkey meatballs, cheese, and marinara.  This isn't the cleanest meal on their menu, but perfect if you're trying to up your calories and at the same time get your protein in.  Taste wise, this was pretty good.  \n\n\nThe restaurant is clean and they should be since they're new.  The staff is great and there are a lot of them.  This Muscle Maker is located near the 24 Hour Fitness, which drove a lot of post-work out diners here. So, it can get busy. Overall, I'm a fan will come back.  I have an office just 5 minutes from here and when it's time to pound some protein, it's nice to know that there's a place minutes from me. \n\n\nTIP:\n-They deliver ($2.50 charge)\n-Recommended by HealthyDiningFinder.com\n-Prices are average", "type": "review", "business_id": "dELL-RCNsq0l1--VwaeXYg"}

Before coming there we checked out the menu online and we thought we had a plan on what we were ordering. We both ordered the Pork Belly over grits.  This was one of those dishes that you continually make that mmmmm sound while you're eating. \n\nWe also ordered the deviled eggs which were good also. I ordered the skirt steak over ox tail ragu and Lori stayed from the plan and ordered the Spare Me Baby, which were baby backs, dry rubbed and mopped  spare ribs, that comes with two sides she got the mac and cheese and the fries with Alabama white sauce. When the food came out we were floored at the portion size!  Everything was tasty. My steak was ordered med rare, it was a little tough but manageable. It was served over hoppin johns which were really good. Lori could only eat one baby back and one of the dry rubbed ribs. \nNeedless to say our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, we were so stuffed and we didn't finish it all. Dave came by smiling and offered to pack it all up for us. Overall the meal was great and we plan to visit again and try some other things on the menu. We also tried one of the lemonades too I had the sidecar and Lori had the cucumber one. They were also very good. \nI highly recommend this place, just make sure you are hungry because the portion sizes are huge and you will be stuffed when you leave.", "type": "review", "business_id": "H3SaoIWnlG-HvGQ8v6J6yg"}

The ladies who run the place are very nice and it's a real asset to the neighborhood to have them here. This is probably the closest little restaurant of any kind to where I live, which makes it very convenient, and the food is better quality then KFC, Church's Chicken or the other fast food places nearby.

I ordered the rainbow roll and the fish was okay again nothing amazing very similar to sushi from a grocery store and for the price defiantly not worth it I also ordered the albacore nigiri and that was a huge disappointment, a coworker ordered the Godzilla roll it was so big and tasteless too much work for a blain roll , onto the burgers the bison burger was served literally burnt and the fries were over salted ,the lobster linguini was flavored good  but for the price you get 1 1/2 claw very tiny  and a very small portion of pasta that was undercooked lastly another coworker ordered the gluten free chicken salad (a plus this place has a gluten free menu) so you really couldn't go wrong with lettuce , we also had to constantly ask for refills mind you our group was only 9 people very disappointed .

I had high hopes with the great reviews on Yelp.\n\nOur food came after awhile, I got the Green Flannel. I took a bite. It was cold, not even warm, colder than room temperature. Eventually the waitress came back to check on us. I had to send it back to be remade. My friends steak was warm, her eggs were cold. She thought about sending it back too, but said it was okay and didn't. She tried my Green Flannel and agreed that I had to send it back, since it was so cold.\n\nMy second Green Flannel came out, it was mostly jalape\u00f1os and barely any hash. The waitress said my eggs were coming... I would have liked my whole meal at once. And then I had to remind her about my toast. We had to go to the counter to ask for the check, since our waitress seemed to be distracted and not really paying attention. She ran the bill and the took forever to bring it, so we went to the counter again to sign. The staff was playing with the remote and watching football. I have never written a bad review on a restaurant before, this is my first. I eat out frequently around Phoenix. My friends would consider me a foodie. \n\nThe kicker: I ordered coffee at the restaurant, but I did bring in my own coffee in my Sacramento naked lounge to-go glass coffee mug. I accidentally left my unique mug and didn't realize until the afternoon, after they had closed. I called this morning, less than 24 hours later, to see about picking it up today and I was told by the manager (maybe owner) that he threw it away yesterday afternoon. \"You didn't call yesterday, so it went out with the trash. I can't keep everything that people leave.\" I could see 2 days later throwing it away, but less than 24 hours? And blaming the customer, for not calling by closing at 4pm? Really? Do you throw away people's drivers licenses or credit cards if they don't come back for them before closing? No lost and found for things that your customers accidentally leave behind? No you just thrown it away. Unacceptable. \n\nPlatinum Service: treating others how they want to be treated. Restaurants come and go. There's plenty to choose from in Phoenix. I'd sure be more mindful how you treat your customers, you lost one. And I will not be recommending your establishment.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wdCE3h8JECzE1vfU1t2TwQ"}

I went for lunch the opening week and got the salmon teriyaki lunch.  It came with your standard miso soup, salad, rice, soft tofu, and creamy potato side dish.  The food itself was good and what you would expect from a Japanese restaurant, but the long wait killed it... not on it's own.  The long wait to order, to get tea, for the food to come out, and then needing to ask for a spoon for the miso soup.  I understand this was opening week and some kinks were probably being worked out so I decided I should come back during dinner to see the full tapas menu and give it another shot. \n\nThat day and the next they were doing 50% off the bill so the next day at dinner I recruited a friend to check out the tapas menu with me.  It was more of the same regarding service, despite having more than one server interact with us throughout the experience. This happened the previous day.  The other funny thing was the same primary server who tended to us at dinner was also the one who was taking care of me at lunch the previous day.  I understand when it's stupid busy and a lot of people are coming through, you can't remember everyone, but she didn't recognize me from the previous day even though she invited me back to check out this particular menu, and the place was never packed the both times I happened to be in.\n\nThe dinner menu is large and easy to get lost in, we got the chicken yakisoba which was great, the halibut roll, a couple other dishes that weren't memorable, my friend wanted the bacon asparagus dish, which had a hair in it.  We let the server know just so they could make the kitchen aware.  They apologized and offered us ice cream.  Overall the decor is very traditional and I can tell a lot of thought and care went into it.  The staff is friendly and I feel like they're trying but there has to be some disconnect between the front and back of the house.  The food was good but was coming out very slowly and sporadically, I think that's related to the previous statement. Oh and they have been picking the weirdest Pandora channels for music, it was mostly some super slow r&b and a couple Pandora ads. Some people might find it petty for me to mention it, but I noticed it and kind of found it entertaining.   I'm not sure if or when I'll try this place again because I feel like I got burned back to back, especially with the other reviews being so enthusiastic about this place.  Maybe I had bad luck both times?  I'll give it some time before taking another shot here, there are so many options explore in Chinatown alone, and all around Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XH8jwPQGD35tkNs6p_e7cg"}

Or me?\n\nWe arrived on a Saturday evening for our 6:30 reservation and were greeted by four people at the hostess stand - a little bit overwhelming. We were promptly seated at a two-top next to the huge windows that overlook the outdoor seating and main road. Although the fella liked the atmosphere, I felt like they'd slapped a few stone columns and wood beams on a brand new, shiny, apartment building restaurant, and it felt too sterile or something. \n\nOur waiter was nice but way too sales-y for me. \"Have you been here before? No? Because a ton of people have already been here three or four times since we opened because it's SO good.\" Ok, guy. He also gave us the whole history of how the wood beams were reclaimed from... I have no idea because I zoned out on the 5 minute spiel.\n\nWe started with the shrimp appetizer ($12). The shrimp were fine, but the bread they came with was pretty delicious, as was the salty, garlicky, buttery sauce it was all in. For dinner, I got the scallops ($28 - recommended by sales-y waiter), and the fella got the grouper ($30 - also recommended). The fella said his grouper was pretty spectacular. I got four scallops - I gave one to the fella, and he asked if they were blackened. Nope, that one was just burnt on the bottom. The second one was good. The third one was so bitter I couldn't eat it. The fourth one was mildly bitter. The fella wondered if they all came from different batches; how could four scallops be so different? Thankfully, we got the sweet potato side, and I ate all of it because I was starving from not eating my scallops.\n\nWe also got a bottle of water and had to tell four different waiters not to fill up our glasses with regular water, even though the bottle was sitting right on the table. I know, I know... first world problems.\n\nAfter dinner, we moved to the bar for an after dinner drink, but it was super loud, and there wasn't anywhere to stand, much less sit, so we left.\n\nMaybe my expectations were too high or maybe I was just cranky, but I was wholly unimpressed - and hangry - by the time we left.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hWhkm0CBERtqa-EhTmpecA"}
